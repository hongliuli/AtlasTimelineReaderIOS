[Desc]In the Alps, building the world's longest tunnel
I'm a kilometer inside one of the Alps and nearly 800 meters below the surface, and it's pitch black. And I'm falling at 14 meters a second.

But this isn't a story of fire and brimstone. It's a story of the construction of the world's longest tunnel, a new 57 kilometer all-flat rail line deep under the Swiss Alps that is planned to open in 2017 and which is hoped to double the capacity of cargo along the crucial Zurich to Milan line. It's also Switzerland's largest-ever ecological project.

This is the Gotthard Base Tunnel, part of a $14.4 billion effort aimed at cutting the number of heavy trucks passing over the Swiss Alps in half, while also drastically reducing the physical toll on these essential roads and slashing the amount of pollution being spewed in the region.

[Desc]Pop artists make BMWs their canvas
They've been shown in some of the temples of the art world--the Louvre in Paris, and the Guggenheim museums in both New York and Bilbao, Spain. They've been featured in television commercials. And they are the work of some of the most famous artists of the 20th century.

These are not paintings, though. These are cars. The BMW art cars, to be exact: a group of 17 BMWs that have been personally adopted by a group of the most celebrated pop artists in history. While the vehicles have raced in Le Mans and toured the world, they've never before been all together at BMW's own museum here.

Until now. Through September 25, almost all of these 17 art cars will be on display at the BMW Museum, giving those who visit a chance to see what happens when famous artists try their hand at an all new kind of canvas.

The project began in 1975 when the world-renowned sculptor and kinetic artist Alexander Calder was asked by his friend Herve Poulain to paint a BMW race car. And 17 cars later, Jeff Koons got to try his hand at the series.

But only one of the artists actually painted his car himself--the others had created maquettes off of which the work was done. Only the famous Andy Warhol actually painted his car.

Indeed, Warhol painted one of BMW's most illustrious cars ever, an M1, (shown left) and he did the whole job in 28 minutes. In fact, he finished so fast, a TV crew that had been hired to document the work was too late to capture it.

[Desc]Sending America's war wounded home
When soldiers are too badly injured in Afghanistan or Iraq to be treated in the war zone, they must be taken elsewhere to heal. The first stop for most is this Air Force Base, which is also the "gateway to Europe" for most soldiers.

The first step for wounded soldiers is to be sent to Ramstein. If they need a quick treatment, they can get it there, and then be sent back to the theater. But if they need further care, they are often first stabilized at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near here and then sent back to a hospital in the United States.

Some soldiers being sent back to the U.S. will heal fairly quickly, or at least do not face life-threatening injuries. But others face long recoveries, especially those who have suffered lost limbs or traumatic brain injury.

Crews at Ramstein are trained to handle the patients as they arrive on the plane from the war zone, to help them while in Germany, and then to put them back on the plane for home.

Here, an ambulance pulls up to a C-17 that has just arrived from Iraq carrying several severely wounded, as well as other less wounded, soldiers.

[Desc]'Mad' King Ludwig's fairytale castle
This is the world famous Neuschwanstein Castle, the onetime home of "Mad" King Ludwig II. Ludwig, who was King of Bavaria from 1864 to 1886, wanted a home near the castle he grew up in--known as Hohenschwangau--that he could retreat to and get away from the sycophants who plagued him, as well as the public. Work began in 1869 and ended in 1886.

But Ludwig nearly bankrupted the monarchy making the castle, and in order to remove him from the throne, he was declared insane. Arrested in his bedroom in the castle--which was still not finished--he was taken to another palace in Munich. There, the next day, he went for a walk with his psychiatrist, and later that evening, the two were found dead. The cause of their deaths was never determined to anyone's satisfaction.

These days, Neuschwanstein is one of the most visited attractions in Europe, with more than 1.3 million annually, despite its inconvenient location in southern Bavaria, just across the Austrian border. Here, we see a classic view of the castle from the famous Marianbrucke bridge.

[Desc]How Lego makes its bricks 
If you're a Lego fan like me, visiting this little town in western Denmark is a little like making a religious pilgrimage.

That's obviously an overstatement, but this is the home of Lego, maybe the world's most famous toy, and as part of Road Trip 2011, I got a chance not only to visit the company's headquarters but also to see the production, processing, and packaging of the famous bricks.

The whole process is actually quite simple. Making the bricks involves injecting very hot plastic into a mold and pressing it. Cool it a bit, open the mold, and out drops Lego bricks.

This is from the second part of the process, when bricks and other elements--such as these soon-to-be mini-figures--are finished by adding any additional parts, like legs, arms, and heads, and having anything they need printed on, like a suit and tie.

[Desc]Giant-scale model airport amazes
I heard about the giant scale-model airport during the last stages of planning CNET Road Trip 2011, and because I was already passing through Hamburg, I decided to stop in at the Miniatur Wunderland, where it is located, to check it out. And why not? It sounded cool, and besides, it accompanies the world's-largest model train collection.

Still, before I arrived, I didn't know what to expect and whether or not I'd be disappointed. If you were thinking of going to Hamburg and checking this out, but had doubts of your own, let me dispel them: this is one of the coolest things ever.

The airport is huge, a 1:87 full representation of the city's airport. And while that airport might not be world famous, when it's depicted in models, it should be. The airport is just like the real one looks, with a large tarmac, plenty of airplanes, a full runway, and--believe it or not--airplanes that take off and land.

This is accomplished through a smart system that raises tiny rods into the planes as they begin their--fully automated--taxi down the runway, and lifts them up into the air. The same works in reverse for landings.

All in all, this is a fantastic part of a truly terrific collection--one that in all features eight miles of tracks on which 900 trains run. It is well worth a visit. Your expectations should be high.

[Desc]The world's largest model train collection
It all started when two brothers who owned a dance club and a music label decided to ditch that business and build the world's largest model train collection. Despite the guffaws of the skeptics, they raised a few million dollars and started putting it together. Their project resulted in what's called Miniatur Wunderland, which has grown from nothing in the year 2000 to draw more than a million visitors a year and become the largest attraction besides the zoo in this port city.

The collection--which features eight miles of train tracks, more than 900 trains, 5,000 cars and other vehicles, and even a full reproduction of the Hamburg airport--is hard to be believe. It has reproductions--some faithful, some fanciful--of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, a special Hamburg section, Scandinavia, and a small U.S. piece.

The collection is on two floors, and though not all the tracks are visible to the public, the entire eight miles is contiguous. (Otherwise, it wouldn't qualify to be the world's biggest)

This is a wide view of one of the Switzerland sections, including the Matterhorn.

[Desc]3D like you've never seen it before
In the consumer products industry, making things like lamps can often mean working with a Chinese or Taiwanese manufacturer, creating a mold, and turning out thousands and thousands of copies of the same item. Consumers get their lamp, hopefully at a decent price, but there is no room for customization, and design aesthetic is either not a consideration or raises the price considerably.

But here in this cosmopolitan Dutch city, a company called Freedom of Creation is on the vanguard of a movement to change the way things like lamps, handbags, iPhone and iPad cases, and countless other items are designed and made.

Rather than relying on traditional manufacturing methods, the company is a leader in the nascent 3D printed consumer items industry. That means that while FOC, as it is sometimes known, has a catalog of items you can buy, all have a very high design style, all can be customized in just about any way imaginable, and all-new products take just weeks from concept to delivery instead of months or years.

The reason is that 3D printing allows retailers to make a one-off, or a set of items, from any 3D digital file. No molds are necessary. All it takes is loading the file onto a computer, and letting one of the increasingly powerful and accurate 3D printers make the item. And because a 3D printer can make just about anything that can be designed, there are very few limits as to what can be created, and sold.

For example, look at this purple lamp, which is a material color test of another lamp that Freedom of Creation sells. The detail work on it is likely far beyond what could be done with mass production, yet its price, 400 euros, is probably only a little bit higher than what a much less detailed but high-design lamp would cost.

This lamp is made from a nylon material and was made using a 3D printing process called laser-sintering, in which a high-temperature laser is used to fuse materials together.

For the next six days, the aviation world--and its fans--are converging on Le Bourget, the old airport here, for the Paris Air Show, the world's biggest celebration of airplanes and everything about them. The show is a mixture of the latest and greatest in both commercial/civilian and military aviation, as well as a showcase for some of the most successful aircraft in the industry.

In this gallery, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman focuses on the military side of things.

This is the RAF Hawk TMK 2, from BAE Systems. The plane is used by the British Royal Air Force for, among other things, training its pilots to "transition to handling current and future-generation military jets such as the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II."

The plane is outfitted with OC2--which provides simulated radar and sensor functions that include defensive aids, a radar warning receiver, and "an enhanced weapons suite."

[Desc]D-Day and the battle for Normandy
In the pages of modern history, there are few days as significant as June 6, 1944. On that day, tens of thousands of American, British, and Canadian forces invaded the Normandy region of Northern France, a mission that finally freed France from the grip of the Nazis, and hastened the slow, but firm defeat of the German army.

Of course, the invasion, known as D-Day, didn't come without a price. Thousands upon thousands of soldiers from all sides were killed in one of the most violent days of World War II, and the blood spilled that day is still remembered--with cemeteries for each nation's dead, including Germany's, spread around Normandy.

And the battle for Normandy didn't last just a day. Throughout June, 1944, battles raged in the area as the Allies fought fiercely to evict the occupiers and free the French.

But it all began on a group of beaches that will forever be known by their code names: Omaha, Utah, Juno, Sword, and Gold. The Americans fought for Omaha and Utah; the British for Gold and Juno, and the Canadians for Sword.

It has now been 67 years since D-Day, but in Normandy, remembrances of the battles fought that day and in the weeks that followed are everywhere. From small museums in many towns to memorials spread far and wide to hotels filled with pictures of American soldiers posing with local girls.

This is a landing craft, known as a Weasel--or "Barge with a Charge"--that is said to have been one of the very first types of vehicles that was driven onto Omaha Beach on D-Day. This model of a Weasel is housed at the Omaha Beach Memorial Museum.

[Desc]The Chunnel, deep inside and behind the scenes
For many Americans, the idea of taking the train from England to France, or vice versa, means one thing: the Eurostar. But actually, Eurostar is just one customer of a much larger operation: the Eurotunnel, otherwise known as the Chunnel.

Since the 31-mile-long tunnel opened in 1994, more than 265 million passengers, and more than 53 million vehicles--including 16 million heavy goods vehicles--have traveled across its tracks.

Each day, 50 Eurostar trains take passengers between London and either Paris or Brussels, but that's just a fraction of the 450 trains a day that pass through the tunnel carrying trucks, containers, cars, buses, and more. And because it takes trains just 35 minutes to go between the Continent and England, the tunnel has become serious competition for the ferries that used to dominate such transportation.

While the Eurostar is by far the most well-known customer of the Eurotunnel, many companies are customers of the Paris-based organization that runs the tunnel. And it also runs its own trains, selling space to passenger cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicles.

[Desc]Breaking the Nazis' Enigma codes at Bletchley Park
They say that it would have taken at least two more years to defeat the German military had not some of the Nazis' secret codes fallen into the hands of the Allies.

For decades, since 1918, the Germans had been using Enigma cyphers as the core of their intelligence and military communications system. The Enigma was first invented for scrambling financial communications, but while that use never took off, the military saw the promise of the system. For one thing, the Germans thought Enigma was unbreakable.

But based on techniques arrived at, and a version of Enigma built by, Polish mathematicians, the master codebreakers at Bletchley Park, a secret installation about 45 minutes outside London, eventually proved the Germans wrong. Still, it took years to beat Enigma, a machine with "complexity [that] was bewildering," according to information provided on the Bletchley Park Museum's Web site.

At the same time, the Nazi high command was sending coded messages using a device called the Lorenz. To solve that, Bletchley Park's code breakers came up with a machine called Colossus.

CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman visited Bletchley Park as part of Road Trip 2011. And last year, as part of Road Trip 2010, he visited the U.S. National Security Agency's National Cryptologic Museum in Ft. Meade, Maryland, where many related items such as a collection of Enigmas, are on display. This gallery showcases some items from Ft. Meade that complement what's on display at Bletchley Park.

Correction (Monday, 3:50 p.m. PDT): This article has been modified to correct errors that confused work done at Bletchley Park on Colossus with that done there on the Bombe machine, as well as to credit work done on Enigma by Polish mathematicians.

[Desc]The battle to save Venice 
If you've heard that this famous city, built on islands, is sinking, you've only heard part of the problem. Over the last 100 years, it has indeed lost 23 centimeters of land, but today, there are bigger problems facing Venice and seriously threatening its future.

Venice and other nearby towns are inside the 550-square-kilometer Venice Lagoon, which is connected to the Adriatic Sea. Rising tide levels inside the lagoon are resulting in these towns, including Venice itself, becoming more frequently flooded--three to five times each fall and autumn. At the same time, erosion of the littorals--the areas close to shore--mean that local beaches, which are considered crucial defenses for developed areas against storms, are increasingly disappearing. And finally, a local petrochemical center and deep canal excavation are contributing to reduced water and sediment quality, as well as the deterioration of local habitats, such as shallows and salt marshes.

In order to address these problems, the Venice Water Authority--created in the 16th century--along with the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, and a consortium of Venetian engineering firms, has embarked on a series of major projects, including a massive $6.7 billion infrastructure project called the Mose system, as well as a beach reconstruction project and efforts to counteract the degradation of the lagoon environment and its natural habitats.

The Mose system is all about the construction of a large series of sophisticated gates that are going to be placed at the entry to the three lagoon inlets. The idea behind the gates is that they can sit idle in the water when unneeded, but during storms, they can be automatically raised to isolate the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. This should, according to the Consorzio Venezia Nuova, defend the city against floods, as well as protect port activity, the morphology of the lagoon, and its water quality.

It may not be the longest passenger plane in the world, or necessarily the most famous. But the Airbus A380 is unquestionably the biggest: a true double-decker airplane that can carry more passengers than any other commercial plane in the sky.

Built to carry 525 passengers in a standard 3-class configuration, the A380 is a behemoth of a plane that Airbus says today leads the industry in cost per seat mile. While other airliners may be seen as rivals, "you have to have [an] A380 to compete with an A380," Airbus says.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2011, reporter Daniel Terdiman visited the A380 final assembly line in this airport town just outside Toulouse, France. While the major components of the plane--the fuselage, wings, tail, tail fins, and more, are manufactured at Airbus facilities elsewhere, they are shipped to, and assembled, here.

What emerges from this factory, which Airbus says is the largest industrial building in Europe, is a massive airplane, one that has been flown--or at least ordered--by 18 different customers, including 11 of the world's top 20 largest.

[Desc]Tiny French village, meet giant Airbus A380
The job of ferrying the major components for an Airbus A380--the largest passenger airplane in the world--is so big that France built a 124-mile-long road dedicated to the task.

While the final assembly of the A380 is done in Toulouse, France, the plane's major components--the wings, three sections of fuselage, the tail fins, and other parts--are built in Germany, England, Spain, and France. And in order to make it to Toulouse, they must first be shipped individually to Bordeaux, France, where they begin their final voyage as separate parts. First they are put on a barge, and then the 124-mile overland trip begins.

The road is called the Itineraire a Grand Gabarit, and every two or three weeks, one of the A380 convoys makes its way slowly down the route, which was created mainly with the idea of avoiding towns and bridges. It cuts through a lot of countryside, and can be seen carving paths through fields of crops.

But the route could not avoid all towns. And in Levignac, a tiny village not far from Toulouse, each of the convoys passes through--usually late in the evening, and usually accompanied by hundreds of people who come out to watch the gigantic airplane components as they are very, very carefully slipped through the town's narrow streets. It is, in short, a big party.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2011, reporter Daniel Terdiman dropped in on Levignac for the most recent convoy, and got a chance to see one of the oddest marriages ever: big, modern airplane components and old, small French village.

But little things like less driving and less cost--since taking the A75 (the autoroute that includes the Millau Viaduct) saves drivers about $21 in tolls versus what was required to go from Paris to Perpignan prior to the bridge's opening in 2004--are just details when you look at this bridge from just about any of the many different viewing spots.

"Although basically a British Austin Seven built under license," a sign at the museum reads, "BMW's engineers were able to incorporate many improvements such as four-wheel brakes, a larger all-steal body, and a higher standard of interior equipment and trim."

[Desc]Where the Zeppelins are made 
The blimp is so 20th century. Just ask Goodyear. Known around the world not just for its tires but also for its famous grey blimps, the company is said to be moving on from its traditional airships in favor of the modern version of a very old design.
The old design? Zeppelins, the airborne specialty of this town on the edge of Lake Constance that is in fact home to the Zeppelin Museum. And while they first flew in 1900 and became the most famous--and most infamous aircraft in the world--for a time, Zeppelins eventually faded away. Until recently, that is, when a company based here began making the airships again.

Known as Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik (ZLT), the company produces what is known as the Zeppelin NT, a new take on the venerable airship. Currently, three of the company's Zeppelins are making their way through the skies of the world, and with what it says is Goodyear's purchase of three Zeppelin NT model 101s, meant to replace those famous but aging blimps, it would have six airborne.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2011, reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped by ZLT in Friedrichshafen and got a first-hand look at the hangar where the company keeps the zeppelin that it uses to take passengers on flights, and where it is slowly building new airships.

If you like watches, and you like history, there may not be a better place to visit than the Patek Philippe Museum here. Those who make the trek to the stately building located a short distance from Lake Geneva will find what has to be one of the most important collections of watches in the world. Six hundred years' of watches, to be precise. And they're not just from Switzerland, although the museum also houses a great collection of Patek Philippe's own masterpieces. And there's even a master watchmaker showcasing his skills for all to see. Altogether, the museum is the famous company's effort to show the tools and techniques used by the craftsmen, the jewelers, engravers, lapidaries and many others who have made the world's greatest personal timepieces since the 16th century.

As part of Road Trip 2011, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman visited the museum, and over three floors, saw many different themes presented. There are enameled watches, watch cases, snuff-boxes and portrait-miniatures which together illustrate the development of the art of enameling. The museum library includes more than 7,000 books on the study and measurement of time, or horology.

But if you visit the museum, you may also enjoy a small thematic tour, and to have a guide explain the fascinating singing birds, "perfume pistols" and other automata and musical pieces, the enameled pieces, or to tell you more about the history of more than 500 years of humans attempting to capture and understand time in small packages.

[Desc]Frank Lloyd Wright masterpieces abound in Oak Park
The Midwest is full of famous Frank Lloyd Wright buildings like Taliesin, the Robie House, the SC Johnson headquarters, and others. But in a way, it all got started here, in this tony suburb of Chicago.

When Wright was still working for someone else -- Chicago architect Louis Sullivan -- he set up shop in a building he designed himself. From 1889 to 1909, Wright and his family -- wife Catherine and six of his seven children -- lived here. The building was also expanded to include his expansive professional studio. Known as the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, this beautiful building is at the heart of a neighborhood full of Wright masterpieces (see gallery here).

The property became Wright's architectural laboratory, as he tried out many of the ideas he became famous for -- open spaces, built-in furniture, windows that made it possible to see the greenery outside, and much more -- here before he implemented them in commissioned buildings.

If it's possible to pinpoint the moment when the nuclear age began, it was December 2, 1942. Under the stands at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, inside a closed-off squash court, 49 of the world's best physicists watched as the first-ever nuclear reactor went critical. And, having proved that such a self-sustaining chain reaction was possible, a key moment in the study of the nuclear synthesis of plutonium for bombs, the arms race was on.

Known as Chicago Pile-1, this was the reactor that was built by Enrico Fermi and many others to demonstrate that a nuclear chain reaction was possible. The effort, done under the auspices of the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, the precursor to Argonne National Lab, was a key step in the development of the Manhattan Project, the creation of the atomic bomb.

While those with high security clearances sometimes have access to powerful government supercomputers, academics, scientists, and engineers often have not. That's why the National Center for Supercomputing Applications launched Blue Waters, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers, in March. Funded with an initial $208 million grant and a five-year operations grant of $151 million by the National Science Foundation, Blue Waters was installed at the National Petascale Computing Facility at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana.

With the capacity of completing in excess of a quadrillion calculations per second on a sustained basis -- and ten times that at peak performance -- Blue Waters was meant to be ideal for providing the scientific community with the processing speed, data storage, memory, and communication necessary to take on many of the most complex computing tasks.

The supercomputer comprises 22,640 Cray XE6 nodes and 3,072 Cray XK7 nodes with NVIDIA graphics processor acceleration. The XE6 nodes have 64 GB of memory per node, while the XK7s each have 32 GB of memory. Blue Waters also boasts a quick online storage capacity of 26 petabytes, and 380 petabytes of longer term tape data storage.

[Desc]Making Goodyear's next-gen blimp 
Anyone who has ever watched a major sporting event on TV is no doubt familiar with the famous Goodyear blimp. For decades, the tire giant's airships have flown over events of all kinds, providing aerial footage even as they advertise the company's tires.

But now Goodyear is getting ready to retire its three American-made blimps and replace them with three zeppelins designed by Germany's Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik (ZLT).

Why? For three main reasons. First, zeppelins fly differently than Goodyear's traditional blimps and offer television event directors the ability to have cameras essentially hover overhead and get better, more consistent shots. Second, the new airships are quieter. And finally, they fly faster, longer, and more efficiently.

Though Goodyear announced its plans in 2011, few have seen the company's progress as it builds its new zeppelins -- which it will continue to call blimps in order to maintain the "Goodyear blimp" brand. But on Road Trip 2013, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped in at the company's Wingfoot Lake blimp operations near Akron and got a firsthand look at how the new zeppelin is coming together.

[Desc]The Memphis Belle comes back to life 
It's one of the most famous airplanes in America's military history, a B-17 that became part of lore by being the first heavy bomber to complete 25 missions in Europe during World War II, and return home.

When the strategic bombing campaign against the Germans began in November 1942, it wasn't known if it would be successful. Many didn't make it through 25 missions -- the threshold for being able to go home -- but the Memphis Belle succeeded and instantly became a major public relations coup for the American military.

After returning to the United States, the Memphis Belle was sent on a national war bond tour, making dozens of stops around the country and driving up spirits everywhere it went.

After the war, the plane was relegated to a boneyard in Oklahoma before being rescued by the Mayor of Memphis. Then, the Air Force got a hold of the plane, and in 2005 brought it to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton and began a long-term restoration project, the goal of which is to return the plane to what it looked like when it was flying bombing missions in Europe.

Now, the plane is being meticulously worked on by the experts in the museum's restoration shop, and CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped by to check out the work during Road Trip 2013. It is expected that sometime late next year or in early 2015, the plane will be moved inside the museum itself, where the general public will be able to see the final restoration process.

Perhaps the most striking of all the planes in the museum is the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which first emerged from its Palmdale, Calif., hangar on November 22, 1988. According to the museum, "B-2 Spirit merged the high aerodynamic efficiency of the "flying wing" design with composite materials, special coatings and classified stealth technologies. As a result, the B-2 became virtually invisible to even the most sophisticated air defense radar systems....Based at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., the B-2 soon demonstrated its combat capabilities in Operation Allied Force over Serbia in 1999, Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan in 2001, and Operation Iraqi Freedom over Iraq in 2003.

"With a crew of only two -- the pilot in the left seat and the mission commander in the right -- a typical combat mission consisted of a non-stop flight from Whiteman Air Force Base to the target and back. During these missions, normally lasting more than 30 hours and requiring numerous aerial refuelings, each B-2 delivered up to 40,000 pounds of precision weapons."

[Desc]Road to Indy: The life of a Goodyear racing tire 
 When you buy a set of new Goodyear tires for your car, you have every reason to expect that they'll last you 80,000 miles. But when a Nascar team gets its hands on a set of Goodyear's racing tires, the expectation is a little lower: just 100 miles.

For years, Goodyear has had the exclusive contract to provide racing tires for Nascar. And that means that over the course of a year, Goodyear makes approximately 100,000 tires for Nascar teams, at a pricey $474 per.

As part of Road Trip 2013, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped in at Goodyear's racing tire manufacturing facility in Akron to see how they're made, and then saw the other end of their lifecycle (although not the exact same tires) at one of Nascar's biggest events, the Brickyard 400, at the Indianapolis Motorspeedway.

Goodyear's racing tires are made to exacting specifications and are tracked at every step of the way after being delivered to a race team. That's because everyone involved -- from the racing teams, to Nascar, to Goodyear -- wants to see how the tires perform, not least because simply looking at them and seeing how they're worn after a race can tell a lot about how the car that used them was driven.

Nascar teams are trained to change a full set of tires in about 15 seconds, as seen here. But sometimes, even that many seconds is the difference between winning and losing. In this year's Brickyard 400, eventual winner Ryan Newman held off favorite Jimmie Johnson by electing to replace just two tires during his last pit stop, saving precious seconds.

[Desc]In Dallas, JFK's memory still haunts
Even if they've never been here before, most visitors to this giant Texas city will instantly recognize Dealey Plaza.

The site of one of the most infamous moments in US history -- the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 -- this otherwise pleasant landscape will forever be known for the death of the 35th American president and the pall that event cast on the blossoming vigor of the 1960s.

The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, located in what was in 1963 the Texas School Book Depository, offers a comprehensive look at the life -- and death -- of JFK.

Among the compelling exhibits is the above FBI-created model of the president's motorcade moving down Elm Street at the moment Kennedy was shot. Made to determine whether it was possible JFK had been shot by presumed assassin Lee Harvey Oswald from the sixth floor of the book depository, the model establishes that the official explanation is at least plausible.

 If you've ever flown, you've doubtless sat through the list of emergency procedures at the beginning of the flight. But did you listen?

Southwest Airlines flight attendants don't have the luxury of tuning out when they're training for their jobs, especially not when learning how to handle an onboard emergency like a fire.

At its Dallas headquarters, Southwest runs this cabin trainer, known as the Poolie, which lets the flight crew practice what to do in a crisis.

[Desc]Making the world's most efficient locomotive 
Who doesn't love trains? Especially when they're being manufactured?

As part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman visited General Electric Transportation's massive facility here, a 1-million-square-foot factory where the company makes locomotives.

GE says these locomotives are the world's most efficient -- measured by generating the least emissions in the industry -- and are delivered to customers and are often hauling cargo the same day.

First photo:
Here, a locomotive is inside the paint shop. Currently, all locomotives made in the Fort Worth factory are being sold to BNSF Railway, so this machine will soon sport the orange and black livery of BNSF.

[Desc]How robots can help soldiers haul their heavy gear
One of the biggest issues facing U.S. military combat units is that individual soldiers or Marines carry, on average, 130 pounds of gear. Though they are usually fit and strong, that load can wear them down.

Though it's very early in the game, the military is considering ways to take some of that weight off their shoulders, and one option is an autonomous ground vehicle system capable of carrying much of the non-essential gear soldiers and Marines take with them into the field.

Several companies are vying for a potential military contract, and as part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman visited Lockheed Martin's Missiles and Fire Control offices here for a demonstration of that company's Squad Mission Support System (SMSS)

[Desc]How the Navy trains its pilots 
If you're in the Navy and you want to fly planes, there's a pretty good chance you'll spend some time here.

One of two bases where the Navy trains pilots, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi is home to two squadrons of would-be aviators. Today, they are flying both the venerable T-34 and the newer T-6B, but before long the T-34 will be phased out.

One of the linchpins of pilot training here is using the T-6B simulator, and on Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman got to try his hand at flying the "plane."

[Desc]How the Air Force hardens planes against signal leakage 
When the president of the United States flies anywhere, it goes without saying that he and his entourage want to be sure that any communications being generated on board Air Force One are safe from prying eyes (or ears).

The same is true of communications aboard any Air Force aircraft, and that's why members of the 24th Air Force, based out of Lackland Air Force Base here, work hard to "harden" every plane the service flies, ensuring all communications are safe from eavesdroppers.

As part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman traveled to Lackland to see how the Air Force secures its aircraft and their communications from any kind of unintentional leakage.

[Desc]In Austin, Prof. Dumpster lives the good life 
In a world of dwindling resources, the average American lifestyle is almost certainly unsustainable. Yet most people don't have a model for how to live differently.

That's what Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, wants to provide. An environmental sciences professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University here, Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.

For a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living. But the goal is to do that living with zero waste, and extremely minimal use of power and water.

As part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman came to the Texas capital to see just how comfortable one can be living in a glorified trash can. Turns out, if you're willing to let go of a few creature comforts, it's not too bad.

[Desc]Into the wild blue yonder: US Air Force basic training 
Every year, the U.S. Air Force graduates about 35,000 new airmen. Each and every one of them comes to Lackland Air Force Base here, where they spend eight weeks in intensive basic training.

It all begins each week when between 400 and 700 new trainees are brought to Lackland, where they must first get all their gear, including their boots and caps. If they survive the training, they get their airman's coin and join what they are told over and over again is "the best air force the world has ever known."

CNET Road Trip 2014 visited Lackland to see the beginning and ending of the airmen's eight-week journey.

[Desc]Training astronauts 40 feet deep
If you're NASA, how do you train astronauts headed for the International Space Station to work on their assigned tasks in a way that suitably mimics the ISS' zero-gravity environment?

The ingenious answer is with a large-scale model of the ISS 40 feet under the surface of a giant pool.

At the Neutral Buoyancy Lab here, associated with, but a 20 minutes drive from, the Johnson Space Center, that's exactly what NASA does -- bringing in each astronaut with ISS missions coming up and giving them regular underwater sessions during which they can practice many of the steps they'll eventually be performing in space.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited the NBL and saw up close how this works, as well as how incredible an ISS mock-up looks underwater.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I did stop in on Elvis Presley's former home. It's by no means a hotbed of technology, but it does offer quite a bit of history and context about the American music industry given Elvis' outsized impact on entertainment from the mid-1950s through the mid-'70s.

His impact wasn't just cultural. He also won nearly every award the music industry offers, including countless gold and platinum records, many of which are seen here on the wall in what was once Elvis' racquetball court.

You may think the boxes you send or receive through FedEx have it rough, but nothing they go through is like what the more than 4,000 a year that the company processes at its Package Lab are subjected to.

The company offers a free service -- to any FedEx customer -- to test how a package will perform under very tough conditions. This is crucial for companies that ship lots of products. If they pass, great. If not, the lab offers recommendations on how to make them survive in the future.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I traveled to Memphis to see first-hand the kind of torture FedEx puts these packages through.

Frank Lloyd Wright designed hundreds of buildings over his long career, and he's arguably America's best architect. Yet there's only one Frank Lloyd Wright skyscraper: the 19-story Price Tower in this small town in northeast Oklahoma.

The design is based on one Wright created for a building that was supposed to be erected in New York City in the 1930s. But economic hard times made it impossible for that building to become reality.

When Hal Price, the owner of a global oil pipeline company came calling, Wright knew just the design he wanted for Price's new office building in Bartlesville.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited Price Tower to see how Wright's work translates into a tall office building.

If you want to see 787 Dreamliners be fully assembled, you have to go to either Everett, Wash., or North Charleston, S.C. But if you want to see how the front section of the next-gen airplanes are made, you have to travel to Kansas.

For decades, Boeing had a large presence in Wichita, but in 2005 the company decided to spin out its facility here as a private company. And that's how Spirit Aerosystems was born. Now, Spirit is involved in the manufacturing process for a number of major aircraft, including the Dreamliner, Boeing's 737, 777, and 747, as well as some of Airbus' airplanes.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited Spirit in Wichita to see how the Dreamliner's front section comes to life.

Above, you can see what is known as a "barrel," the very beginning of a front section. The barrel is comprised of several smaller sections known as mandrels. Once the mandrels assembled, a giant machine methodically winds thousands of pounds of composite "slit tape" around the barrel, gradually forming the shape of the forward section.

Ever wondered what happens to an oil rig when it's no longer producing? Since 1990, 450 in the Gulf of Mexico have been transformed into artificial reefs as part of a series of state-run programs known as Rigs to Reefs.

Thanks to the programs, which are run in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida, the oil companies donate the rigs rather than tow them back to shore, and also donate half their cost savings.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I traveled more than 100 miles into the Gulf to check out one of the rigs -- technically known as a production platform -- from 100 feet below the surface, where thousands of fish, including this barracuda, have a comfortable home.
