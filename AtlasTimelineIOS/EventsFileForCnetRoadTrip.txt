[Desc]Frank Lloyd Wright masterpieces abound in Oak Park
The Midwest is full of famous Frank Lloyd Wright buildings like Taliesin, the Robie House, the SC Johnson headquarters, and others. But in a way, it all got started here, in this tony suburb of Chicago.

When Wright was still working for someone else -- Chicago architect Louis Sullivan -- he set up shop in a building he designed himself. From 1889 to 1909, Wright and his family -- wife Catherine and six of his seven children -- lived here. The building was also expanded to include his expansive professional studio. Known as the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, this beautiful building is at the heart of a neighborhood full of Wright masterpieces (see gallery here).

The property became Wright's architectural laboratory, as he tried out many of the ideas he became famous for -- open spaces, built-in furniture, windows that made it possible to see the greenery outside, and much more -- here before he implemented them in commissioned buildings.

[Desc]In Chicago, the birthplace of the nuclear age 
If it's possible to pinpoint the moment when the nuclear age began, it was December 2, 1942. Under the stands at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, inside a closed-off squash court, 49 of the world's best physicists watched as the first-ever nuclear reactor went critical. And, having proved that such a self-sustaining chain reaction was possible, a key moment in the study of the nuclear synthesis of plutonium for bombs, the arms race was on.

Known as Chicago Pile-1, this was the reactor that was built by Enrico Fermi and many others to demonstrate that a nuclear chain reaction was possible. The effort, done under the auspices of the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, the precursor to Argonne National Lab, was a key step in the development of the Manhattan Project, the creation of the atomic bomb.

[Desc]Up close with America's national supercomputer, Blue Waters
While those with high security clearances sometimes have access to powerful government supercomputers, academics, scientists, and engineers often have not. That's why the National Center for Supercomputing Applications launched Blue Waters, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers, in March. Funded with an initial $208 million grant and a five-year operations grant of $151 million by the National Science Foundation, Blue Waters was installed at the National Petascale Computing Facility at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana.

With the capacity of completing in excess of a quadrillion calculations per second on a sustained basis -- and ten times that at peak performance -- Blue Waters was meant to be ideal for providing the scientific community with the processing speed, data storage, memory, and communication necessary to take on many of the most complex computing tasks.

The supercomputer comprises 22,640 Cray XE6 nodes and 3,072 Cray XK7 nodes with NVIDIA graphics processor acceleration. The XE6 nodes have 64 GB of memory per node, while the XK7s each have 32 GB of memory. Blue Waters also boasts a quick online storage capacity of 26 petabytes, and 380 petabytes of longer term tape data storage.

Given that Frank Lloyd Wright designed Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Tokyo's Imperial Hotel, and many other great buildings, it's hard to say which one is his greatest.

But after visiting Robie House here as part of Road Trip 2013, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman thinks he might have seen the best Frank Lloyd Wright building of them all.

With what is the quintessential example of Wright's Prairie Style of architecture, Robie House is a stunning work of art. Located at the University of Chicago, the house, completed in 1910 for businessman Frederick C. Robie, is in the middle of a major, multi-million-dollar renovation that should return it to its original glory.

[Desc]Making Goodyear's next-gen blimp 
Anyone who has ever watched a major sporting event on TV is no doubt familiar with the famous Goodyear blimp. For decades, the tire giant's airships have flown over events of all kinds, providing aerial footage even as they advertise the company's tires.

But now Goodyear is getting ready to retire its three American-made blimps and replace them with three zeppelins designed by Germany's Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik (ZLT).

Why? For three main reasons. First, zeppelins fly differently than Goodyear's traditional blimps and offer television event directors the ability to have cameras essentially hover overhead and get better, more consistent shots. Second, the new airships are quieter. And finally, they fly faster, longer, and more efficiently.

Though Goodyear announced its plans in 2011, few have seen the company's progress as it builds its new zeppelins -- which it will continue to call blimps in order to maintain the "Goodyear blimp" brand. But on Road Trip 2013, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped in at the company's Wingfoot Lake blimp operations near Akron and got a firsthand look at how the new zeppelin is coming together.

[Desc]The Memphis Belle comes back to life 
It's one of the most famous airplanes in America's military history, a B-17 that became part of lore by being the first heavy bomber to complete 25 missions in Europe during World War II, and return home.

When the strategic bombing campaign against the Germans began in November 1942, it wasn't known if it would be successful. Many didn't make it through 25 missions -- the threshold for being able to go home -- but the Memphis Belle succeeded and instantly became a major public relations coup for the American military.

After returning to the United States, the Memphis Belle was sent on a national war bond tour, making dozens of stops around the country and driving up spirits everywhere it went.

After the war, the plane was relegated to a boneyard in Oklahoma before being rescued by the Mayor of Memphis. Then, the Air Force got a hold of the plane, and in 2005 brought it to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton and began a long-term restoration project, the goal of which is to return the plane to what it looked like when it was flying bombing missions in Europe.

Now, the plane is being meticulously worked on by the experts in the museum's restoration shop, and CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped by to check out the work during Road Trip 2013. It is expected that sometime late next year or in early 2015, the plane will be moved inside the museum itself, where the general public will be able to see the final restoration process.

[Desc]A century of the best of the U.S. Air Force 
For fans of the history of aerial warfare, there is probably no better place to visit than the National Museum of the United States Air Force, based here at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

As part of Road Trip 2013, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped at the museum and saw many of the most important aircraft in American history.

Perhaps the most striking of all the planes in the museum is the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which first emerged from its Palmdale, Calif., hangar on November 22, 1988. According to the museum, "B-2 Spirit merged the high aerodynamic efficiency of the "flying wing" design with composite materials, special coatings and classified stealth technologies. As a result, the B-2 became virtually invisible to even the most sophisticated air defense radar systems....Based at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., the B-2 soon demonstrated its combat capabilities in Operation Allied Force over Serbia in 1999, Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan in 2001, and Operation Iraqi Freedom over Iraq in 2003.

"With a crew of only two -- the pilot in the left seat and the mission commander in the right -- a typical combat mission consisted of a non-stop flight from Whiteman Air Force Base to the target and back. During these missions, normally lasting more than 30 hours and requiring numerous aerial refuelings, each B-2 delivered up to 40,000 pounds of precision weapons."

Fortunately, it has never come to this. But if the United States ever found itself in the middle of a nuclear war, it would need the ability to get a command and control center off the ground and away from potential attack targets in just minutes.

That's precisely what the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) is all about. A set of four E-4Bs -- which are Boeing 747-200s modified to support the military's doomsday communications needs -- these planes were designed to allow the country's most senior military officials to stay in charge and control during a nuclear crisis, or something approaching that level of seriousness.

The planes are based out of this Air Force Base, which is also home to U.S. Strategic Command, and was the longtime home of U.S. Strategic Air Command, just south of Omaha.

[Desc]Why Frank Lloyd Wright piled 60 tons on a lily pad
Frank Lloyd Wright is famous for many of the incredible homes he designed -- Fallingwater, the Robie House, Taliesin, and so many more. But his design for the SC Johnson Wax company headquarters in this town just south of Milwaukee has touched many more people on a daily basis than any of those masterpieces ever did.
The highlight of the building is its world-renowned Great Workroom of the headquarters' administration building, a half-acre open space filled by nearly 60 21-foot-tall dendriform (shaped liked a tree) columns that almost seem to float throughout the room.

The great triumph of the columns, which are also collectively known as a lily pad, is that they effortlessly hold up the roof, allowing for walls made partially of glass tubes -- a design that allows a great deal of natural light to flood the space during the day.

As part of Road Trip 2013, CNET's Daniel Terdiman jumped at the chance to see how the great architect could achieve what to others seemed certain to defy the laws of physics.

[Desc]Road to Indy: The life of a Goodyear racing tire 
 When you buy a set of new Goodyear tires for your car, you have every reason to expect that they'll last you 80,000 miles. But when a Nascar team gets its hands on a set of Goodyear's racing tires, the expectation is a little lower: just 100 miles.

For years, Goodyear has had the exclusive contract to provide racing tires for Nascar. And that means that over the course of a year, Goodyear makes approximately 100,000 tires for Nascar teams, at a pricey $474 per.

As part of Road Trip 2013, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped in at Goodyear's racing tire manufacturing facility in Akron to see how they're made, and then saw the other end of their lifecycle (although not the exact same tires) at one of Nascar's biggest events, the Brickyard 400, at the Indianapolis Motorspeedway.

Goodyear's racing tires are made to exacting specifications and are tracked at every step of the way after being delivered to a race team. That's because everyone involved -- from the racing teams, to Nascar, to Goodyear -- wants to see how the tires perform, not least because simply looking at them and seeing how they're worn after a race can tell a lot about how the car that used them was driven.

Nascar teams are trained to change a full set of tires in about 15 seconds, as seen here. But sometimes, even that many seconds is the difference between winning and losing. In this year's Brickyard 400, eventual winner Ryan Newman held off favorite Jimmie Johnson by electing to replace just two tires during his last pit stop, saving precious seconds.

[Desc]How the Air Force hardens planes against signal leakage 
When the president of the United States flies anywhere, it goes without saying that he and his entourage want to be sure that any communications being generated on board Air Force One are safe from prying eyes (or ears).

The same is true of communications aboard any Air Force aircraft, and that's why members of the 24th Air Force, based out of Lackland Air Force Base here, work hard to "harden" every plane the service flies, ensuring all communications are safe from eavesdroppers.

As part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman traveled to Lackland to see how the Air Force secures its aircraft and their communications from any kind of unintentional leakage.

[Desc]In Austin, Prof. Dumpster lives the good life 
In a world of dwindling resources, the average American lifestyle is almost certainly unsustainable. Yet most people don't have a model for how to live differently.

That's what Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, wants to provide. An environmental sciences professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University here, Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.

For a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living. But the goal is to do that living with zero waste, and extremely minimal use of power and water.

As part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman came to the Texas capital to see just how comfortable one can be living in a glorified trash can. Turns out, if you're willing to let go of a few creature comforts, it's not too bad.

[Desc]Into the wild blue yonder: US Air Force basic training 
Every year, the U.S. Air Force graduates about 35,000 new airmen. Each and every one of them comes to Lackland Air Force Base here, where they spend eight weeks in intensive basic training.

It all begins each week when between 400 and 700 new trainees are brought to Lackland, where they must first get all their gear, including their boots and caps. If they survive the training, they get their airman's coin and join what they are told over and over again is "the best air force the world has ever known."

CNET Road Trip 2014 visited Lackland to see the beginning and ending of the airmen's eight-week journey.

If you tell people you're visiting this city of 655,000 in the southwest corner of Tennessee, you'll almost always get asked, "Are you going to Graceland?"

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I did stop in on Elvis Presley's former home. It's by no means a hotbed of technology, but it does offer quite a bit of history and context about the American music industry given Elvis' outsized impact on entertainment from the mid-1950s through the mid-'70s.

His impact wasn't just cultural. He also won nearly every award the music industry offers, including countless gold and platinum records, many of which are seen here on the wall in what was once Elvis' racquetball court.

[Desc]Why FedEx beats up packages in a lab 
You may think the boxes you send or receive through FedEx have it rough, but nothing they go through is like what the more than 4,000 a year that the company processes at its Package Lab are subjected to.

The company offers a free service -- to any FedEx customer -- to test how a package will perform under very tough conditions. This is crucial for companies that ship lots of products. If they pass, great. If not, the lab offers recommendations on how to make them survive in the future.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I traveled to Memphis to see first-hand the kind of torture FedEx puts these packages through.

[Desc]Thorncrown Chapel, Arkansas' great glass masterpiece
Conceived as a folly by an alcoholic California schoolteacher, Thorncrown Chapel in this northwestern Arkansas hamlet, shocked the world. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's most-accomplished student, Fay Jones and opened in 1980, Thorncrown Chapel won many of architecture's most prestigious awards.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I came to the Ozarks to see the "Glass Chapel," Jones' biggest masterpiece, and a testament to the commitment of the schoolteacher, John Reed.

[Desc]Inside Frank Lloyd Wright's only skyscrape
Frank Lloyd Wright designed hundreds of buildings over his long career, and he's arguably America's best architect. Yet there's only one Frank Lloyd Wright skyscraper: the 19-story Price Tower in this small town in northeast Oklahoma.

The design is based on one Wright created for a building that was supposed to be erected in New York City in the 1930s. But economic hard times made it impossible for that building to become reality.

When Hal Price, the owner of a global oil pipeline company came calling, Wright knew just the design he wanted for Price's new office building in Bartlesville.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited Price Tower to see how Wright's work translates into a tall office building.

[Desc]In Kansas, where 787 Dreamliners are born
If you want to see 787 Dreamliners be fully assembled, you have to go to either Everett, Wash., or North Charleston, S.C. But if you want to see how the front section of the next-gen airplanes are made, you have to travel to Kansas.

For decades, Boeing had a large presence in Wichita, but in 2005 the company decided to spin out its facility here as a private company. And that's how Spirit Aerosystems was born. Now, Spirit is involved in the manufacturing process for a number of major aircraft, including the Dreamliner, Boeing's 737, 777, and 747, as well as some of Airbus' airplanes.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited Spirit in Wichita to see how the Dreamliner's front section comes to life.

Above, you can see what is known as a "barrel," the very beginning of a front section. The barrel is comprised of several smaller sections known as mandrels. Once the mandrels assembled, a giant machine methodically winds thousands of pounds of composite "slit tape" around the barrel, gradually forming the shape of the forward section.

[Desc]The great Boeing metal-airplane shop
When most people think of Boeing commercial jet production, they likely think of Seattle, and the aviation giant's major facilities there.

But if you want to know where the Boeing 737 -- the world's best-selling jet -- is really born, you have to come to Wichita.

That's where Spirit Aerosystems, formerly a Boeing division, now a standalone company, manufactures 737 fuselages, as well as major components for every other Boeing commercial plane, including the composite 787 Dreamliner, and the aluminum 747, 757, 767, and 777.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited Spirit in Wichita to see how the 737 comes to life.

[Desc]In the Gulf of Mexico, from oil rigs to fish havens
Ever wondered what happens to an oil rig when it's no longer producing? Since 1990, 450 in the Gulf of Mexico have been transformed into artificial reefs as part of a series of state-run programs known as Rigs to Reefs.

Thanks to the programs, which are run in Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Florida, the oil companies donate the rigs rather than tow them back to shore, and also donate half their cost savings.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I traveled more than 100 miles into the Gulf to check out one of the rigs -- technically known as a production platform -- from 100 feet below the surface, where thousands of fish, including this barracuda, have a comfortable home.

[Desc]Town goes all green after devastating tornado 
On May 4, 2007, an EF-5 tornado -- the largest measured in the US in years -- flattened this small town, destroying 95 percent of its buildings.

In the aftermath, the people of Greensburg decided to rebuild with an emphasis on green building principles, and in the years since has become a model for how to develop a sustainable community. It now boasts the highest per-capita percentage of LEED-certified buildings in the United States.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I visited Greensburg to see what "Green Town U.S.A." looked like. This is an aerial view, taken using a DJI Phantom 2 Vision-plus, of Greensburg's Silo Eco-Home, a bed and breakfast and live-in sustainable model home.

It's hard to know how you're going to feel starting at $320 million in cash.

As part of CNET Road Trip 2014, I got a chance to visit the Western Currency Facility, where the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing produces the majority of America's paper money.

I wanted to see how the latest $100 bills, which have been in circulation since 2013, are made, from the engraving process through printing and packaging. The visit didn't disappoint, especially when I found myself standing in front of five "skids" of $100 bills totaling $320 million. There's a deep sense of longing mixed with an urge to be as nonchalant as you can in the face of such a visceral display of riches.
