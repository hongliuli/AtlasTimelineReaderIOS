New Version (not released yet, add on 3/20/2015)
    - animate show/hide
    - Improved and simplified time wheel visual effect by removed border and gap.


Version 1.3.1
    - Fix event editor min/max bug
    - display related Chronicle Map in Chinese as 霞客行

version 1.3
    - Scroll map in camera mode when jump to another location, greatly enhance user experience on map.
    - improve event list text readability by differing text darkness for date, title and content.
    - Use text button to emphasis event list mode: timewheel or map mode.
    - improve map mode eventview refresh loop performance
    - Related apps list is from server.
    - use a UIView to do photo description editor, removed a third party customizealertview for photo desc editor
    - Improve select on event list view to make sure everytime will show thumbnail
    - Tried hard to automatically switch event list view mode and give up. The main problem is in automatic mode, each time scroll map will cause many executions such as refresh event list view, very soon the memory warning will occure frequently. I tried to use timer or time delay technic, but always has glitch.
    - xcode6 does not work for min/max event editor etc


#### Photos are linked to GoogleDriver PhotosForWWII directory.####

Test overlay
Think of photo flag (eventType), should scan again to set it by checking if directory exist
EventEditor allow save for photo only, add an "Full" button
Focuse: remove focuse button, every time click marker will forcuse automatically, same as select on event list view
Add "Author Area" in manual to download file, Web-based upload file to "aaa@bb.com" directory
Instruction to author contents and send photos


Restrictions: 
    mostly cased by using date as nuiqueId that could cause detached photos if author modified date in new version


Next version should allow user to choose file to validate the contents the authored. may be the only way is to use dropbox file chooser framework.
