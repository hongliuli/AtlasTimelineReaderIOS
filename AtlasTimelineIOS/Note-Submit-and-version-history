Test overlay
Think of photo flag (eventType), should scan again to set it by checking if directory exist
EventEditor allow save for photo only, add an "Full" button
Focuse: remove focuse button, every time click marker will forcuse automatically, same as select on event list view
Add "Author Area" in manual to download file, Web-based upload file to "aaa@bb.com" directory
Instruction to author contents and send photos


Restrictions: 
    mostly cased by using date as nuiqueId that could cause detached photos if author modified date in new version


Next version should allow user to choose file to validate the contents the authored. may be the only way is to use dropbox file chooser framework.
