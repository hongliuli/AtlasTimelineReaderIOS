- How to copy photos from Documents to Bundle: (so end user does not need to upload to dropbox, I can get photo this way)
    xcode6->Windows->Devices->Download xcappdata; then "Show Package Content" to get photo file.
    (Then copy to Google Driver, and xcode link it, make sure assign to right target in "Show File Inspector)
- Where to keep file for PhotoUrl.txt file:
    This file will not package into distributon. After implement document picker, this file can be any name. But for now it has to be this name for all targets.
    For now I will save it in google driver such as PhotoUrl_cnetroadtrip.txt etc

Changes on original AtlasTimeline to AtlasTimelineReader:

    Read from Db first, if the db is empty, read from file and save to Db
    
    


    
Read file from bundle:
----------------------
content will be nil (which logs as '(null)') if you pass it a path it can't open. So your only issue is that the relevant instance of NSBundle is unable to find test.txt within the resources part of your application bundle.

You should:

check the file is in your Xcode project; and, if it is,
check it's included in the 'Copy Bundle Resources' phase underneath your selected Target (in the project tree view on the left in the normal Xcode window layout) and, if it is,
look inside the generated application bundle (find your product, right click, select 'Reveal in Finder', from Finder right click on the app and select 'Show Package Contents', then look for your file in there) to make sure that it's there.
