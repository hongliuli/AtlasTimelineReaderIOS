Seen here is the fork where trains can continue to head in the direction they were going, or switch to the crossover tunnel. That is expected to be done in cases of maintenance on one of the two one-way tunnels, or when there is an accident.

Most of the major excavation work was done using a tunnel-boring machine like this one.

In order to work on the ceiling of the tunnel, workers had to set up major scaffolding, like seen here.

Underneath its smooth concrete surface, the tunnel has three layers: a drainage layer, a waterproofing layer, and an inner shell. Seen here, a section of the tunnel has different layers showing and in progress.

Here we see a section of the tunnel fully covered in the protective membrane. It will then be covered in concrete and smoothed out.

Anyone heading deep into the tunnel--800 meters below the surface--must first descent from the town of Sedrun on this little cable car.

In this small office in Sedrun, a worker can monitor the control room monitors and see what is going on in several different places at once. Here, with computers, one person can run the ventilation system, the electrical system, traffic inside the 800-foot-deep shaft, and keep track of who's inside the tunnel.

At Staziun Alpina, small trains (that were once used in the construction of the Eurotunnel, otherwise known as the Chunnel) ferry workers from the surface to the shaft elevator that takes them 800 meters below the surface.

Through the window of the small train, it is possible to see the entrance to the Sedrun portal to the Gotthard Tunnel.

Through the window of the train, it is possible to see deep into the 1 kilometer long tunnel that leads to the 800-meter-high shaft that takes workers and visitors down into the main tunnel system.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/4a1e29b3-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e0d4af2879a817cd3b06ffd37a60c6ee/Trains_in_the_big_chamber.jpg
At the bottom of the shaft there is a giant chamber, where workers come to and fro, and several small trains are gathered to take people or materials around.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/4a14088f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4550964e51355f298ce7048f4881ff9b/Finished_section.jpg
After years of work, this is a nearly finished section of the Gotthard Tunnel. Note the smooth interior surface. Under that concrete are several layers designed to keep the tunnel solid and to keep it dry.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/4a0bb025-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9bbc35c88a1d7e3cc4f8bfe7a1acaed0/Finished_emergency_station.jpg
One important element of the tunnel project is the construction of two emergency stations designed to quickly and safely offload passengers from a burning train. Though the stations are 20 kilometers apart, the idea is that if a troubled train can make it to the station, passengers can quickly disembark and escape through special tubes that take them to adjacent safety tunnels. Those tunnels, because of a slight overpressure, are supposed to be free of smoke, no matter how much is coming from a burning train.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/4a0597ba-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/50446d113208cbe606392c007bb266d0/Fire_door.jpg
A fire door is designed to keep fire and smoke out of the passageways through which passengers on troubled trains can escape.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49feceed-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5d90cf92009113cf71dcd333961e8852/Down_ventilation_shaft.jpg
There are seven ventilation shafts like this one above the emergency stations. The idea is that smoke can be lifted out quickly, making it easy for passengers to escape a burning train that has made it to the emergency station without smoke inhalation.
If a train cannot make it to the emergency station, there are still escape passageways every 325 meters throughout the tunnel, though they only lead passengers to the parallel one-way tunnel rather than to a fully safe and secure section of tunnel.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49f083af-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1242f5334527061e0e602d5bde542e0e/Finished_connecting_passageaway.jpg
This is a finished connecting passageway. There are sections like this every 325 meters throughout the tunnel. These passageways can allow anyone to escape a troubled train that cannot make it to an emergency station.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49e8a5a6-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9a781971924c285a3f37f9357050c439/Future_station.jpg
Gotthard Tunnel planners decided to future-proof the project by excavating a cavern where a major train station could be built in the future. This station, which could be the deepest underground in the world, as well as the highest elevation major station in the world, could serve as many as 3,000 skiers a day in Sedrun, Switzerland. But there are no plans to finish this part of the project. Instead, the cavern will be closed off from the main tunnel. The idea, though, is that by digging out the cavern now, it opens the possibility of the station in the future, while not doing it now would prohibit its ever being done.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49d7d374-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/db31c6e255ef81c44da95a1d263f46e0/Massive_ventilation_tubes.jpg
In a major tunnel system, ventilation is clearly important. Here, we see giant ventilation tubes attached to the ceiling of the tunnel.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49d1437e-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3f5c0f30950aa83de4b6216a551d692d/Stop_Risk.jpg
Due to a series of safety programs, injuries and accidents have been cut down significantly on the Gotthard Tunnel project.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49c77c7e-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0688f3440416d1b0e5ecf70cb703694b/Ventilation_tunnel.jpg
There is a ventilation tunnel above the emergency station, designed to pull smoke out from burning trains. This is a connecting passageway to the ventilation tunnel.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49c3d3c5-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8b448f9cd605f0ae072d67b1a6e6289d/Where_the_door_will_go.jpg
The air pressure at the crossover sections could be so great that it could knock a train off the tracks. That's why there will be giant doors installed in front of the crossover sections that are designed to block the air flowing through, or to block fire or smoke. This shows where that giant door will be installed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/05/49bc177a-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d6572de96c1817a6e613c72e037ba6d0/Weather_door.jpg
This is a weather door designed to minimize the heavy flow of air in sections of the tunnel that are still under construction. Sections will have these doors at both ends.

Indeed, Warhol painted one of BMW's most illustrious cars ever, an M1, (shown left) and he did the whole job in 28 minutes. In fact, he finished so fast, a TV crew that had been hired to document the work was too late to capture it.

Here, an ambulance pulls up to a C-17 that has just arrived from Iraq carrying several severely wounded, as well as other less wounded, soldiers.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5e234e9a-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/02c287dcad29386642f2975a5238d12f/Bringing_out_litter_patient.jpg
Here, a crew from the 86th Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility (CASF) carry a wounded soldier off the C-17. Though seriously injured, this soldier is not in as dire a situation as others on the plane. He is what is known as a "litter" patient, meaning he is carried on a cot and doesn't require special equipment. The most serious cases, those that need intensive care, require what is known as a Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT), a team of three specialists who travel with the patient and who carry all the gear needed to tend to him or her while in the air.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5e1917c0-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac6b8941ad15679dab0e2276b663aba9/Taking_CCAT_patient_off.jpg
Here, the CASF crew carefully carries a CCATT patient off the C-17. These patients must be cared for at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center until they are stable enough to be sent to a hospital in the United States. You can see all the gear required to care for the patient.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5e0f4282-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c5e66fce5282f7b8e234f17f43b18fd3/Lifting_CCATT_patient_into_ambulance.jpg
Counting gear required to care for the patient, the CASF crew must carry between 400 and 500 pounds when transferring him or her between the airplane and the ambulance. Here, it takes a group to lift this soldier onto the ambulance.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5e06cf9d-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e84ac549cde192b40567c6682a5caa17/C-17_after_all_patients_out.jpg
After all the patients--both CCATTs and others--have been taken off the C-17, it is nearly empty. This plane, like all others being used for aeromedical evacuations to Ramstein, is a cargo plane that can be configured for many different uses. Ramstein has the ability to call for an airplane at any time for an evacuation, regardless of one of the regular flights scheduled to fly there is ready to go. The pilots who fly there are trained to fly several different kinds of airplanes.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5e0084e6-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1fa7f7b251b0907ff3e620a474402e65/Offloading_patient_luggage.jpg
Here, the CASF crew works to take patients' luggage off the C-17 that has just arrived at Ramstein from Iraq. The red cross tag on the bag seen here means that it belongs to a patient who was flown to Ramstein on the plane.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5df951ca-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/246142f0ca6fc75dc0cb852de2184ea1/CASF_beds_male.jpg
Many of the less serious medical cases generally spend just one night at Ramstein before being flown home to the United States. The CASF maintains two rooms of 25 beds, one for men, and another for women. This is the men's room.

Here, we see the CASF team lined up to help lift patients from an ambulance onto a C-17 that is waiting to take them back to the United States.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5de926eb-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e8030080ee6ca4a1201b6b2e604dada5/Thumbs_up_for_next_patient.jpg
Here, we see Air Force Maj. Mick LuCore, the medical team director, giving the thumbs-up that means the CASF crew can bring another patient off the ambulance and on to the C-17.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5de3295e-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/49630c28f236a24e29efe629761416d2/Jameson_on_plane_thumbs_up.jpg
Army Specialist Jameson Read, who was shot in the arm in Afghanistan, gives a thumbs-up as he is loaded on to the C-17 that will fly him home for a few weeks of physical therapy. He will then be sent back into combat.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5ddd3466-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/78f6d2b1749b3bf90d17871a41b6fe0b/Jameson_gets_his_cookies.jpg
Volunteer members of the USO (United Service Organizations) based at Ramstein often make cookies to send with the soldiers who are flying to hospitals back in the United States. Here, a USO volunteer hands Specialist Jameson Read his bag of cookies on board the C-17.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5dd68f3b-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/33f2c6afca081946f484081a94ab17d8/Taking_CCAT_patient_off_bus.jpg
Here we see the CASF team lifting a CCATT patient off the ambulance in order to take him on to the C-17 that will fly him to a hospital in the United States.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5dd01b66-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0b1b5f11b1705d4b7bb18cfbbb9be58a/General_Ellington_talking_to_wife.jpg
In this photograph, taken on board the C-17 that is about to leave Ramstein for the United States, we see Air Force Maj. Gen. John Ellington, who is also chief of chaplains in the National Guard Bureau, talking with Larissa Daniel, whose husband has suffered a traumatic brain injury, and whose prognosis is unknown.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5dc6fba1-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8faa8fa1643064506bd6ae950e2b199a/Medallion.jpg
Larissa Daniel shows the National Guard Bureau coin given her moments earlier by Gen. Ellington. The coin is meant to convey to her that she is not alone as she cares for her stricken husband.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5dc36b68-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/51ac1940207993db31b0ff2730a8d81f/Going_over_the_plan.jpg
The CASF team goes over the game plan as they prepare to begin loading patients from two ambulances onto the C-17 that is about to take off from Ramstein for the United States.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5dbb9a02-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dc1021d26fa85b7f27a3978309e99be0/Placing_CCAT_patient.jpg
Here, a CCATT patient is carefully placed into the rack aboard the airplane where he will lay during his flight back to America.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5db7106d-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9513c632059278269ce2db0306626ce4/Real_World_CASF_mission.jpg
A sign in the window of the ambulance indicates that the CASF team is not involved in a drill. This involves injured soldiers, and the team's mission is to care for them as best they can.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5daf35a7-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ba085b87819a72ae4e82b6f092d9c4ab/Patient_information_white_board.jpg
This whiteboard in the CASF center conveys crucial information to the soldiers who are spending the night there before being flown home the next day.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5da7673d-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5694ace7abb3c1f756cb03d6ab68f0ef/Special_quilt.jpg
A group called Quilts of Valor often makes special quilts for the wounded soldiers, and many of them take the quilts home with them. Here, we see one folded over the legs of a soldier being carried aboard the C-17.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5da1ac49-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6b44790d7da31600816fdc699c584030/CCATT_kit_on_plane.jpg
For every three CCATT patients, one CCATT team consisting of a physician, a critical care nurse, and a respiratory care therapist flies with them. The team will also bring all the gear needed to give in-flight treatment to the patients. Here, we see one of the CCATT kits aboard the airplane.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5d995330-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/09129a777a48f882d34078071f353dd1/CCATT_kit_ready_to_go.jpg
The CCATT teams also maintain full sets of their gear in a storage area so that the equipment is ready to go at a moment's notice.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5d91833b-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/aebc13c97004b5b6881e42a46b9f36b3/Dog_signed.jpg
In the CASF center, there is a large poster signed by many of the patients who have spent time there. Among those patients is a working dog, who was injured in a fall. The dog was actually given a military rank, and it was the same as the animal's handler. The military sent the dog home, and the handler has been trying to adopt it.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5d8943d6-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f7c5e490e5dbb00cd6cf9ace118d6f35/Information_on_the_Fish.jpg
For three years since Army Sgt. Jesse Ault died in combat in Iraq, members of the 332nd Expeditionary Medical Group there have been trying to send Ault's beloved fish back to his family. Now, the fish are finally being sent home after volunteers raised enough money to get a veterinary certificate allowing the animals to be sent to the United States. This packet contains all the critical details about the fish.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/11/5d7e2ea1-f0f1-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/eafa437ed5b9108419560ebd63d02f26/Fish.jpg
This is one of the two fish being sent back to Sgt. Ault's family in the United States. The two fish were put on the C-17 that left Ramstein on June 10, 2011.

Here, we see a classic view of the castle from the famous Marianbrucke bridge.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/13/5fea8e7f-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5f2358b26982daeceaf3be0d9ea5b29c/Iconic_image_with_mountains.png
This is an iconic view of Neuschwanstein with the Alps behind it, taken on a fall day. The castle was never finished and to this day, its entire second floor remains incomplete.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/13/5fe6911b-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4401980948461c70d1e5789ced92bd5f/Ideal_design.jpg
Ludwig had a penchant for all things German medieval, as well as noble. His ideal design for his new castle was a combination of the medieval and the romantic, as seen here in this design drawing from 1869.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/13/5fe2132f-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2b4b0673151d11d3b5c85b4bdc020d20/After_death_of_King_Ludwig.jpg
This photograph of Neuschwanstein was taken shortly after King Ludwig's death and shows the scaffolding that conveys that the castle was never finished--even when the king was living there, as he did for about six months before his arrest and untimely death at the age of 41.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/13/5fdd37fa-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/76dd6dd367681144ef1fc50b776deda6/Neuschwanstein_far_below_side.jpg
This is a view of the castle from below and to the side. The castle sits high above the small village of Schwangau in Bavaria.

This is a photograph of the Throne Room in Neuschwanstein. A glorious room, it is missing one important element, the throne. It was not finished prior to Ludwig's death and upon his demise, the decision was made to stop working on it.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/13/5fcd8869-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c022d5ca7786a1cdc075b85ab08bf81f/z-Singers_hall.jpg

A lover of opera, Ludwig dedicated Neuschwanstein to the operatic works of Richard Wagner. As well, he had this grotto constructed as a small token "scene" he could wander through whenever he needed a taste of opera.

In this picture, we can see the Austrian Tyrolean Alps, the Alpsee Lake, and on the right side, Hohenschwangau Castle, where King Ludwig II grew up. This castle was constructed by his father, King Maximilian, to replace the original castle on the site, known as Schwanstein. This photo was taken from Neuschwanstein, which means New Schwanstein Castle.

How Lego makes its bricks 
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c7a56b9-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8e947600543f10817e060ec615b41efe/2-C-Lego_HQ_reception.jpg
This is the reception at Lego's world headquarters. Note the way the ceiling and the chairs make up what appears to be two interlocking Lego bricks.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c75402f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c502dfac6f47b5c2cc22f504018fecad/3-M-Bin_of_ABS.jpg
All Lego bricks are made from the same ABS plastic. It comes to Lego from suppliers and is held in giant silos. Generally it is clear or red, and the color for specific bricks is added at the molding machine. This is a bin full of ABS plastic, with some additional colors mixed in.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c6eadea-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/71284fb67df417b663f5e617e1c018ec/4-M-Mold_cross-section.jpg
This is a cross-section of a Lego brick mold. First, very hot plastic is injected into the mold on the right side. It then spreads through little channels and is then pushed into the press area of the mold through very small slits. When cold water is then flushed through the mold, it cools down the plastic, and the mold opens, allowing the bricks to snap off and drop down onto a belt below.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c66c727-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2bbb9b3dfb70ccc55cc3604ce066d188/5-M-Shelf_of_molds.jpg
Currently, there are about 7,000 active molds being used at Lego. All told, it keeps about 9,000 around, with many stored on shelves like this one. The average mold is worth $72,000, with the most valuable coming in around $360,000.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c619953-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/77332f0126093443f080e74450edfb66/6-M-Where_plastic_injected.jpg
Here, we see where the plastic is injected into the press area of the mold.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c5b077f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/56488e2b1dc2b83d43241cdccd0df507/7-M-Ellipsoid_pieces_in_the_mold.jpg
Here we see two ellipsoid pieces that have just been pressed, still sitting in the mold. In a second, they will drop off and onto a belt below.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c54e6ab-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/58f5e2ae142b63727248dcc85efe0550/8-M-Ellipsoid_pieces_mold.jpg
Here we see the mold for the ellipsoid pieces from the previous picture. Note the shape of the mold.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c4e2cea-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d53aac06b8fd8febf3a5eb3905503b57/9-M-Blue_heads.jpg
Part of Lego's system is to be as efficient as possible. That means making bricks and other elements that can be used in different ways. These blue pieces can either be used as heads for mini-figures, or as decorations for other pieces.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c489dc1-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f2d6e05f743f9e9a7505ced5a0fb5c7d/10-M-Purple_pieces_coming_off_belt.jpg
Thousands of purple Lego bricks sit in a bin, having just been pressed in a mold.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c43d346-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7d4bf4d5b61a8c096cf0803191d66709/11-M-Long_aisle_of_molding_machines.jpg
This is one of 12 molding 'modules' located in Billund. Each module, or room, has as many as 64 working molding machines, divided into two aisles of 32 machines each.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c386128-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/537a946b11aab6f8b02762e00cd3665d/12-M-Robot_arm_grabbing_injection_waste.jpg
Here we see a robot arm inside the molding machine grabbing the waste from the injection and molding process. This plastic will be put into a grinder, and reused almost immediately.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c334294-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5c1da4583130c7596fbed5aea3877171/13-M-Bin_of_injenction_waste.jpg
This is a bin full of the waste plastic from each mold.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c2ec21f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/740242c24a9f74612513a14a0b721f74/14-M-Spillage.jpg
Almost none of the plastic used in the Lego factory goes to waste, but a very small amount does get spilled. This giant bin is full of spaghetti-like plastic that has hardened and has no use.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c2629e4-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ea948770ca312d505ed010e95671590d/15-M-Tubes_carrying_ABS_inside.jpg
These tubes carry ABS plastic into the molding rooms. The sound coming from the pipes is very much like what millions of grains of rice would sound like going through pipes.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c1f012a-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5550eccb785f9b703b3e24e7ab7f59d7/16-Ma-Cleaning_a_mold.jpg
A mold is used for about four weeks before it is pulled from the production line and completely cleaned out. Here, we see a Lego worker doing a meticulous cleaning of a mold.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c19aef1-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1ec358776e2ee4d7b216b41b043f1080/17-Pr-Machine_dropping_mini-figure_bodies.jpg
Now in the processing part of the production system, this machine is dropping torsos for mini-figures onto a belt where they will have additional elements like arms and legs and heads added to them.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c14f6fb-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9cdf74e5d7fd273e81ef56c200c9370e/18-Pr-Putting_hands_on_mini-figures.jpg
Here we see a small robot adding hands to a mini-figure.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c0ee4d9-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6c126e59df2597e55fa29864a1aa3dfe/19-Pr-Stamping_details_on_mini-figure_bodies.jpg
Here we see the machine stamping on printed details, such as a face, and a shirt.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c0a7625-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fb97e702bc63c75de24ab1a9215484ff/20-Pr-Weighing.jpg
This display shows the weight of a small bag of Lego bricks known as a pre-pack. The weight must be between 94.9 grams and 95.7 grams. Coming in at 94.94 grams, this back passes muster. However, as the display shows, five bags came in too light, and one was too heavy. But 5,354 were in the target range.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4c031eda-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/de9c88c1f9ffa2515504d176dcf03714/22-Pa-Pre-packages_going_up_belt.jpg
Here we see pre-packs going up a conveyor belt, at the top of which they will be weighed.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bfbdbf9-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6dd2f53a4ac14894167b40a19100b35d/23-Pa-Putting_big_pre-packages_in_boxes_by_hand.jpg
Now in the packaging department, most of the bricks are in packs that are dropped into a package automatically. But some of the packs are too big to fit in when dropped that way and must be shaken and flattened manually in order to fit properly.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bf62078-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/88cac0380528fd5490c9cf560a7247c2/24-Pa-Flat_Star_Wars_boxes.jpg
These are hundreds of flat boxes for Star Wars Lego sets.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bed4c65-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/91f1334a4f4c819a886ff9abd23096cc/25-Pa-Making_sure_not_too_full.jpg
This machine presses down into each Star Wars set that passes through to make sure that the packs of Lego bricks inside isn't too high up. If it is too high, the box may not be able to be closed correctly.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4be3b2a1-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0b5fe5212e2608e7921693c7f4d718a5/28-Pa-Full_Star_Wars_boxes_go_down_the_line.jpg
Here we see full Star Wars boxes moving down the line.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bdaf84f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4acb522ab2671fb9c92c1925aeb40063/26-Pa-Closing_lids_on_Star_Wars_boxes.jpg
Here, the machine automatically closes the lid of the box of each Star Wars Lego set.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bd3a064-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dce899948f7acf16636b598167c44c29/29-Pa-Full_Star_Wars_boxes_come_off_line.jpg
Here we see full and closed Star Wars Lego set boxes coming off the packaging line.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bc5d097-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8c6b7a98cae17693a28b4ff0ba0cf100/27-Pa-Putting_Star_Wars_sets_in_boxes.jpg
As the Star Wars sets are finished, this machine grabs two at a time and puts them into cases of six.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bbfff3f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b8ac360465bb680a048f7c994550e929/30-Pa-Pulling_out_mistake_by_hand.jpg
Here, a Lego worker has to reach inside the machinery and grab two boxes that have accidentally been spun off the belt.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bb8b785-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e82fa9dfcbdf12fe1ea9abe65d68acc1/31-Pa-Boxes_of_six_go_down_the_belt.jpg
Each of these cases contains six Star Wars Lego sets.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/14/4bae8ee9-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/05bca3e1fa7e3406ad6520a495b18634/32-Pa-Shrink-wrapped_and_ready_to_go.jpg
Shrink-wrapped and ready to go, these cases of Star Wars Lego sets will be shipped to the Czech Republic, where they will be handled by a giant distribution center there operated by DHL for Lego.

Planes loading up
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/58070b02-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d2bf2491a46b22d072f0a755837aef00/Airport_-_Taking_off.jpg
Here we see a plane "taking off" from the model Hamburg airport at the Miniatur Wunderland. Planes disappear behind flaps in the wall where they then lower down on the rods that at first lifted them up during take off, and then route their way back automatically to either the tarmac and an airport gate, or to a landing.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57fbb4ca-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2e0f95be41b5631f63ed0e3fc8b7e6e0/Airport_-_Planes_on_tarmac.jpg
The airplane collection features a Thai Airways Airbus A380, an Air France Boeing 777, and many, many others. All told, there are 32 planes in the collection, including an Airbus A350, a plane that doesn't exist yet--but Airbus contributed a model of the forthcoming plane.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57f4b172-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0a97087d788c0c1cc3e0228e98bb2a82/Airport_-_Lufthansa_landing.jpg
A "landing" plane emerges from behind the wall.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57ec9627-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5fa891527d1062f6ef7d251721fc9c48/Airport_-_Air_France_777_turning_for_takeoff.jpg
During a nighttime scene at the Miniatur Wunderland airport, an Air France Boeing 777 prepares to turn onto the main runway in order to "take off."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57e68881-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/52b2bd6744dbeab753f003f34496b4fa/Airport_-_Night_scene.jpg
A plane has just landed at the Miniatur Wunderland airport, seen here during a nighttime moment. At the attraction, days last for 15 minutes, and nights for three minutes. During the nighttime periods, thousands of LED lights automatically turn on, including those seen here.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57de00a7-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/77d61de7f8908913c438fb9873d28036/Airport_-_Cars_and_trucks_auto_charging.jpg
One of the most impressive elements of the airport is that the dozens of small cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicle models are programmed to be smart enough to know when they are running low on battery power. When that happens, they automatically drive themselves to a section behind the walls, out of view of the public, where they dock themselves at one of these stations and stay there until they are charged back up. At that point, they automatically back out, drive back out to the airport and resume their "duties."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57d78eeb-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8ed20dea0c940f1ef98697165c3fa125/Airport_-_Rod_comes_up_for_takeoff.jpg
The way the planes take off is simple. As they taxi down the runway, a small rod emerges from the floor and lifts them up. The programming is smart enough to know which type of plane is taking off, and modifies the angle of ascent to match that of the real-life version of the plane.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57cce903-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b165f6db7e73ab725e9444f9cd2bb172/Airport_-_Control_screen_for_airport.jpg
This is the control screen for the Miniatur Wunderland airport, which shows details on all the planes, all the vehicles, and much more about the complex 1:87 scale model of the Hamburg, Germany airport.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57c150ad-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/268f3b46120a9f3447c864e05a7f8746/Airport_-_Planes_hidden_lined_up.jpg
After taking off, these planes then routed themselves into a section where they line up under the publicly-viewable section of the airport and work themselves back around until they "land."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57bb1860-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e98b21dde330cab3a6842ef6140dd6c3/Airport_-_Parking_garage.jpg
Like so much else in Miniatur Wunderland, this airport parking garage was built by hand, piece by piece.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/57a8748d-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/94207445544937fe9ec759bd111c2379/Airport_-_Shuttle_landing.jpg
Though the real Space Shuttle never landed in Hamburg, at Miniatur Wunderland, it does.

Being Hamburg, it only makes sense that the collection would have a major section on its home city. Indeed, the Hamburg piece is one of the largest parts of the collection, and it features many of the city's landmarks. This is a large representation of Hamburg Central Station.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43d3c3ab-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6f0258a9b94ca08c19fe8d2cc93d111b/Scandanavian_winter_train_station.jpg
This is a scene from the Scandinavia section of the collection, showing what a train station there would be like during a snowy winter.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43cd3f62-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/46cbbf2c6d838e626d06ef91c00d8a0f/Rail_bridge_across_Southwestern_canyon.jpg
This is a scene from the U.S. section of the collection, featuring a rail bridge spanning a Southwestern canyon, most likely a fictional one in Utah.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43c4bb66-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/090d7e52dd27deebedd95896cfaf5efd/ICE_arriving.jpg
In this picture, we see a major train yard, while a Germany Intercity Express (ICE) train approaches.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43bb18bd-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6159eec04a183ddc1f1f04e20829977c/Train_going_under_highway_under_rail_bridge.jpg
This picture shows another scene from the U.S. section of the collection, and we see a train on tracks going underneath a freeway that is itself underneath a rail bridge. The highway has its own traffic, featuring cars and trucks that drive themselves back and forth and, due to a homemade positioning system, manage to avoid collisions with each other--most of the time.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43b383ee-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e31453eb0e5ee6e64f601c14ea57182f/Concert.jpg
Besides a gigantic collection of trains and eight miles of train tracks, the collection also has 250,000 tiny people spread around an endless number of little dioramas, each of which tells a story of some kind. Here, we see a giant concert, with 25,000 "people." There is music playing, and the little screens show video from real concerts. Out of the frame, there is also a giant field of little tents and cars, and all the other things--like portable toilets--necessary for a large outdoor musical event.

This is another scene in which the planners at Miniatur Wunderland took an opportunity to tell a story. This is from the American section of the collection and depicts what appears to be a group of aliens taking over a U.S. military plane. Presumably, this is supposed to be Roswell, N.M.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43a71a92-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d1075f1d8fe951922ae51e2d3a9fb9f9/Underground_Roswell_scene.jpg
Many of the stories being told in the collection are hidden away and you have to either spot them by accident or go looking for them. This is directly under what is seen in the previous picture and shows what is supposed to be a hidden UFO, and a whole underground base for dealing with aliens. Again, this is likely supposed to be Roswell.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/439f9edb-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e2dac081b1799f7f7146125fbb25bc15/Control_Center_wide.jpg
This is the command center for the entire Miniatur Wunderland collection. Here, technicians can monitor all the train tracks, the lighting built into the system, and all the little cars and other vehicles. They can also control more than 200 cameras to see how things are going, and whether there are any situations that must be dealt with.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43994f7e-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a0d6404286b5489fa012f9ddc19ba168/Control_Center_-_close-up.jpg
This is a close-up of the command center, showing a technician monitoring a number of screens, each of which shows a section of track. Though the trains have pre-set routines, the technicians can also intervene and direct the trains.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/4392bc00-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/244cf0d648070487c5f71d9d0566e8b1/Backstage_tracks.jpg
Behind the walls, there are endless sections of train track, like the ones seen here. This is because the train tracks must be continuous in order for the collection to be considered the world's largest, and there is not enough room in the building for all the track. So, each of the eight major sections are connected by tracks that are under the floors, in the ceilings, behind the walls, and sometimes even on little bridges in doorways.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/438b20be-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7aaf59ec715c16e546824f2085aa2f83/Sebastian_ducking_down.jpg
Here, Sebastian Drechsler, one of the three brothers who run the collection, ducks down as he explains how the behind-the-walls parts of the track system work. He's ducking because the ceilings are extremely low behind the walls.

Here, we see a train exiting one tunnel and about to enter a second in an Alpine section of the collection.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/436afebf-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c8497f8243e3320f1c93a71e86b58631/Porta_Alpina.jpg
During the construction of the Gotthard Tunnel--the longest tunnel in the world, at 57 kilometers--planners who were trying to figure out how to divert half of the truck traffic through the Swiss Alps also thought they might want to build the world's deepest train station.
Eventually, they decided to excavate the area where the station would go, but also decided not to build the station any time soon. However, because they excavated it, they can choose to go back and build the station when the need arises.
At Miniatur Wunderland, that time has already come, and this is their representation of what the platform in the station would look like.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/4364bb0d-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dc4758db5a2d9ccff2a52812e0428661/Porta_Alpina_number_2.jpg
This is a look through a second in-the-wall window at the Porta Alpina station, this time at what it would like beyond the train platform.

The brothers who built the collection are very technologically savvy, and built many of the back-end systems that control all the trains, cars, and so on. These are the processors responsible for running the vast train system.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/16/43261197-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6e1dba96ab093f7f08672f61368ddb52/Servers.jpg

This lamp is made from a nylon material and was made using a 3D printing process called laser-sintering, in which a high-temperature laser is used to fuse materials together.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c33e696-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ec3898c73cd8a7ac8eb0b78ade8ef965/Stereolithographty_for_Asics.jpg
At Freedom of Creation's Amsterdam office, there are countless examples of the company's work, many of which are tests and samples. Some are also items the company created for corporate clients. This item, which isn't for sale, was created for a shoe display for Asics, using copper-plated stereolithography. Note the many, many details in the piece.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c2d82da-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a48a39c6ae90e7e9153bb9cf766df558/Break_packaging.jpg
Freedom of Creation also made this piece for Asics as part of a promotion. The item has printing on it that encourages someone finding it to break it open and find a puzzle piece inside. Each one of these items was slightly different, and all were made in their own individual 3D print job. All that was different between each job was that the digital file was manipulated a bit to change some of the details. The puzzle piece is loose inside the frame, something that can be done with 3D printing, but would be nearly, if not totally, impossible using traditional manufacturing methods.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c26b149-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/438d678982b599ddaef0c221e2414524/iPad_case.jpg
This is a Freedom of Creation iPad case made out of nylon using a laser-centering 3D printer from 3D Systems. It costs $127. Many of Freedom of Creation's designs have a signature printed on them of the person that created the item, as does this case.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c1e37d6-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/797c3c21f90e954b3c0b9865c0245c5e/iPhone_case.jpg
Freedom of Creation is part owner of a separate company called Fresh Fiber that makes "fashion for electronics." It sells a variety of items like this iPhone case, which is available at Apple Stores for $41.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c18866c-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/605c7805a55c9cb3f988854e32fbdb4e/Dress.jpg
This dress features a complex design with interlocking chains of nylon-based links. It was a test piece done by Freedom of Creation, but it shows how 3D printing can be used to make items with elements like the interlocking chain that would be extremely difficult using normal production methods.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c14b5f7-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b81f0ced22dce19ed1b079ae843b2c65/Handbag.jpg
This is a handbag featuring a handle made to look like brass knuckles. It's made from nylon using a laser-sintered 3D printer. It sells for around $429.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c0fae91-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/68ba67c58b3941f1f289df00d4e8a279/Sand_fruit_tray.jpg
3D printers are capable of making products using a wide variety of materials. This is a fruit tray made from sand on a laser-sintering 3D printer. Yet, despite being made from sand, it is quite strong and is made to last.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c09198a-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/84749a02b1c01d9f33f67e2f65eb970d/Aluminum_8s.jpg
This item was made from a 3D printed wax cast that was then used as the basis for the final product, made from aluminum.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4c001e12-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3b92742b19afdb680426dcc231d3abf9/Headphones.jpg
The base shape for these headphones, which are a Freedom of Creation prototype, are made out of nylon using a laser-sintering 3D printer.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/17/4bf963e5-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f8fc4f2ec89912a86143940f9a820cb2/New_bracelets.jpg
These bracelets are two of Freedom of Creation's newest products. They're made from three materials--glass, aluminum, and nylon. The laser-sintering 3D printer melts the nylon, which then binds all the materials together. The bracelets are sold for between $42 and $57 apiece.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/18/4bf13e7e-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/25111e6cbbead3f3dfeeeea9c2b123ba/Rings.jpg
This is a collection of rings designed by FOC, all done in nylon, and each costing around 27 euros.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/18/4be6c481-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/84a10514425df3f7eae6006b1550c211/3D_printer.jpg
This is a consumer-level 3D printer sold by Freedom of Choice's new owner, 3D Systems. It can't produce objects as high-quality as the ones in the previous pictures, but it can make a lot of functional things. It is available for $1,850.

Here, we see the 747-8 I, as it's called, sitting on the tarmac at Le Bourget, home to the Paris Air Show.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3ec65563-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ede5d77872667e134716a69076eddda4/Flight_deck.jpg
This is the flight deck of the 747-8 I. While there are a few tweaks to the existing 747-400 cockpit design, Boeing decided to leave things very much as they have been so that airlines don't need to fully retrain their pilots to fly the new plane. Instead, they need just three days of instruction to get ready to pilot the Intercontinental.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3ebfc3f2-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/23973efe8ad2ba22b43cfc240cc3c4ad/Captain_explains_flight_deck.jpg
Here, Boeing chief pilot Mark Feuerstein explains some of the features of the flight deck of the 747-8 I to CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3ebbe99b-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5874f1d5b1a120de5d3f4279b9f074ec/Back_at_top_level.jpg
The upper deck of the 747-8 Intercontinental is as long as an entire 737-700, Boeing says. Here, we see the upper deck on the first 747-8 I as it looks at the Paris Air Show--without seats, but with its luggage bins and lighting installed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3eadae50-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4539b819c031664fdccb98e83efea0ce/Ceiling.jpg
On this 747-8 I, the full interior fixtures have not yet been installed, and visitors can see the ceiling of the plane above the luggage bins. This plane will eventually be fully outfitted as a VIP plane by Boeing Business Jets.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3ea94ac1-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/de0d5d44edaeeb5a915e71782b2ceddf/Captain_rest_cabin.jpg
One of the chief advantages of the 747-8 I, according to Boeing chief pilot Mark Feuerstein, is that there is a bathroom and rest quarters behind the flight deck door. This means that pilots will not need to open the door to the cockpit in order to go to the rest room, something that should increase security and allow pilots to not have to wait until service is finished before getting up.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3ea666b0-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4c175a0bd488ed607c48babcc17e6f65/Captain_poses.jpg

Here, we see the electronic checklist, one of the new digital additions to the 747-8 I's flight deck.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3e9bd648-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9766f9038095ce508fe862a0d6ab4e3a/Moving_map.jpg
This is the moving map, another new digital addition to the 747-8 Intercontinental.

The 747-8 Intercontinental that flew to the Paris Air Show is the first of the new line and hasn't yet been outfitted with normal seats. In fact, it is still full of testing equipment and water tanks used to distribute weight.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/20/3e906aa5-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac67128b9a1be7174a2996f91409cd1e/Main_deck_with_water_tanks.jpg
This is a view of the main deck of the 747-8 I, including the many water tanks used to distribute weight around the plane in the absence of hundreds of passengers.

Paris Air Show at Le Bourget here are military personnel looking to buy their next order of helicopters or fighter jets,

Each plane that will be flying an exhibition flight at the Paris Air Show must be very slowly and carefully towed to the flight line, usually through large throngs of people who want to get as close to the aircraft as possible, even as it rolls along the tarmac. The job of keeping the audience back falls to a ground crew, and here we see that ground crew posing for a photograph with a giant Airbus A380--the world's largest passenger plane--behind them, about to turn onto the runway for its show flight.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/5820edb9-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a874f36361d361aa04d5e8eea9d7f9cc/Military_officers_walking_in_group.jpg
At the Paris Air Show, there are top military brass from countries all over the world wandering everywhere. They can be seen in small groups, often with younger officers escorting a colonel or a general, or in large clusters, as in this picture. They come from many different continents, and it's clear they've come to the show to investigate what equipment to spend money on.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/581ab9c0-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/aa1b2d98d71cbb526a5ae538455567e9/A380_takes_off.jpg
The Airbus A380--with Korean Air livery--takes off for its exhibition flight at the Paris Air Show.

As the Airbus A380 waits for its turn to fly, a Russian firefighting tanker plane flies by doing its own exhibition. Here, it appears as though the Russian plane is on the tail of the A380.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/580e5c4c-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/cf723824153f7ac5facf1c85bf18b11c/747-8_I_and_777_and_A380.jpg
In this photo, we can see three planes that compete for the business of the world's travelers. On the left is Boeing's new 747-8 Intercontinental, which is expected to begin flying commercially later this year. In the middle is Boeing's 777-200LR Worldliner. And on the right is the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger plane.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/5808b2d8-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/54c2b31a5e32622d5983413a554cd1ce/Boeing_chalet.jpg
At the Paris Air Show, it's all about where you're located. The biggest companies in the military and aviation business pay to have "chalets" located close to the flight line and the so-called "static displays" of airplanes on the tarmac at Le Bourget, the airfield that hosts the show. The chalets can be small and modest, or they can be large and extravagant. This is Boeing's chalet. Based on its location, a few down from the edge of the flight line, it's not quite as well-situated as that of Airbus, which is just adjacent to the flight line. Then again, Boeing is an American company, while Airbus is a European operation.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/5800d916-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/62821f308f37ead6958d2cf2e3075d16/Crowd_waits_for_A380.jpg
A crowd gathers along the edge of the flight line, waiting to see the Airbus A380 make its flight. The airplane in the foreground is the A380.

As each aircraft is taken to the flight line for its performance, crews must pull them through the length of the display area at Le Bourget. Often that can mean parting a veritable sea of attendees. Here, we see a military helicopter being pulled through the crowds.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/57d2568e-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2a3c864969090d0094c592ba0e368e79/Pushing_small_biplane.jpg
Here's another performance plane, in this case a small bi-plane, being pushed through the crowd toward the flight line. This job is easy with a plane of this size, but when it's a giant aircraft like the Airbus A380, it is a huge undertaking requiring many people to clear the plane's way.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/21/57cadfdd-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/101c6968fffb910b13de31efca59ab12/Senator_Shelby.jpg
This is a golf cart being used by Northrop Grumman to drive U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) around the Paris Air Show. CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman spotted similar Northrop carts being used for other members of a Senate delegation to the show, including Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.); Sen. Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii); and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.).

This is the Acoustic Chamber at ESTEC's Test Center. It is employed to reproduce the noise made by rockets in order to evaluate whether satellites or other space-bound specimen can survive the intense sounds of a launch.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/22/2adb92c8-f0f4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dcadb36a74387a3ee117859db83d1179/Big_speaker.jpg
This is the biggest of four large speakers in the Acoustic Chamber. Measurements will be conducted for about one or two minutes, approximately the amount of time that the most intense noise of a launch lasts. The noise can create vibrations strong enough to damage a satellite or other device, and it's better to learn what damage will happen in a test center than in space after an expensive launch.

Another major feature of the Test Center at ESTEC is its shaker. This is used to evaluate whether satellites or other specimen are capable of handling the shaking produced during a powerful launch. Though there are other shakers located throughout Europe, this one is used when ESA customers--often telecommunications companies testing satellites--can't find another one big enough. Here, we see a dummy satellite on top of the shaker.

Here, we see an airplane fuselage that is ready to be moved onto the ESTEC shaker. This is a prime example of how non-space industries use the shaker--another shaker big enough to evaluate the worthiness of the fuselage couldn't be found outside ESTEC.

Here, we see the Eiffel Tower from just in front of it.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/24/4d7c33ca-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1f3b7e6ebbd8727f65216772bcbc6b0d/Accumulateur_and_lift.jpg
Some might consider the hydraulic elevator system that Gustave Eiffel designed in 1889 to be well ahead of its time. Here's how it works, according to information provided by the organization that runs The Eiffel Tower:
The elevator "passenger compartments, mounted on a carriage and kept horizontal by a leveling system, are pulled upwards by cables that move in line with two parallel pistons located underground, via a cable drum system--the cables themselves, the ends of which are attached to the passenger compartment carriage--run back and forth eight times over two sets of pulleys, one of which is fixed and the other attached to the moving pistons, thereby ensuring that the [elevator] passenger compartments can travel [420 feet], i.e. eight times the piston travel--of 52 feet.
"The pistons are actuated by a water circuit with a pressure of 40 to 60 bar, which until 1986 generated motion thanks to three large accumulators of some 200 metric tons each, which provided both the pressurized water reserve--the energy to drive the motion--and the counterweight function.
"Since modernization in 1986, high-pressure, oil-driven hydraulic motors drive piston carrier motion while two of the three accumulators serve as counterweights."
Here we see two of the hydraulic lifts and one of the accumulators.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/24/4d73cdb5-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7e427278990eb7e31b6d5d5a1a1e9426/Red_wheels_of_hydraulic_lift.jpg
These big red wheels are one of the sets of pulleys mentioned in the previous captions. These are the pulleys attached to the moving pistons.

Just adjacent to the south pillar of the Eiffel Tower, there is a nondescript green cage. This is, in fact, the entrance to a "secret" underground bunker, which was originally designed to belong to the French military. Although today the bunker is open to small guided public groups and contains a collection of Eiffel Tower memorabilia, posters, and pictures, it still connects to military tunnels, and the public is only allowed to go a very short distance inside. It's not known how far or where the tunnels go, but legend has it that they stretch all the way from the Eiffel Tower, under the famous Champ de Mars, and to the Ecole Militaire, the major French military academy.

This diagram illustrates the principles of the hydraulic elevator, as explained in the second caption. Today, two of the elevators are still hydraulic, but two are electric and were installed by Gustave Eiffel for the World's Fair of 1900. But the electric elevators have proved to be more fragile and require more maintenance. Two hydraulic elevators remain to this day as a cultural reminder of the origins of the tower.

According to a plaque in the military bunker, "Gustave Eiffel knew that in order to survive, the Eiffel Tower would have to prove its practical worth for science. The tower was scheduled to be dismantled after just 20 years. [So] he...allowed it to be used for a wide range of scientific experiments, from meteorological and astronomical observations to monitoring physical and air resistance phenomena.
"He secured the future of his tower with the installation of a huge wireless transmission antenna." The tower then became the site of the first radiotelegraph broadcasts of the early 20th century, the plaque says.

In 1935, the Eiffel Tower transmitter became active, and on June 2, 1953, English Queen Elizabeth II's coronation was broadcast live throughout France from the Eiffel Tower.

This is a landing craft, known as a Weasel--or "Barge with a Charge"--that is said to have been one of the very first types of vehicles that was driven onto Omaha Beach on D-Day. This model of a Weasel is housed at the Omaha Beach Memorial Museum.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4eec2802-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8655577acd8d6eedac9e7490c86bfdc9/Ar-Arromanche_pont_cleaned_up.jpg
One of the reasons for the success of the entire Normandy campaign was the construction and use of what were known as Mulberries. These were giant artificial ports built by the British and the Americans to bring in huge amounts of provisions and supplies after D-Day.
In order to build a Mulberry, large numbers of artificial barges were towed into harbors at Arromanches-les-Bains and at Omaha Beach and used to protect long artificial bridges that connected supply ships with the land. Once the ships were connected to the land, all manner of vehicles could simply be driven off of them and onto shore.
Though the artificial harbors were constructed at both places, a furious storm destroyed the one at Omaha Beach, leaving Arromanches-les-Bains as the main artery for supply for the Allies.
Here, in Arromanches, we see a restored section of one of the bridges. Many of these would be linked together in order to drive supplies off the ships and onto the beach.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4ee54278-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3beaaef1f001f6344e0a756267c07329/Ar-Arromanche_Phoenix_on_beach.jpg
The barges used in the construction of the artificial harbor were known as Phoenixes. At Arromanches, there are still about a dozen Phoenixes visible above the water line, and some are now on the shore. Here, we see one of them on the beach, where it is a popular structure for beachgoers to climb on.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4eddad2e-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1646c37f63ca4da6446cdcd38d0008d2/Ar-Arromanche_port.jpg
In this photograph, we see a model of the artificial harbor constructed at Arromanches-les-Bains. At the top of the photo, we can see the long line of barges used as a seawall to protect the harbor, and below that, we can see several long lines of bridge sections connecting supply ships with the shore.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4ed6b45b-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fa6febcde1e60b060b08939e7f609a23/Ar-Anchor_that_made_it_possible.jpg
Before the artificial harbor could work as a way to bring in supply ships--and therefore supply the troops fighting the Germans inland in Normandy--a problem had to be solved: How could you anchor the Phoenixes to each other in such a way that they would not sink, split apart, or otherwise be made useless by heavy waves or bad weather?
The problem was first raised by Winston Churchill in 1942. But the solution came from British Maj. Allan Beckett, who, according to a plaque in Arromanches, designed "the floating roadways, their piers, and the 'Kite' anchors, which enabled the harbor to survive the storm of June 13 to 18, 1944, and to become the key to victory in Normandy.
This is one of the 'Kite' anchors designed by Beckett.

According to information in the museum in Arromanches, "On June 6th, Col. Talley was the 5th Army Corps observer surveying Omaha Beach from a landing craft. After some very anxious moments, he could finally send a positive message to his commanding officer, Gen. Gerow. The message read, "I join you thanking God for our Navy," and it subsequently became a famous D-Day quote implying the decisive role the warships played in dealing with the German defenses.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4eb522cb-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5bd7e90bd5cdb1a6165cfbfeb2742fee/Lo-Whole_battery_gun_raised.jpg
This is one of the four 155mm guns the Germans placed at Longues-sur-Mer, each with a range of 12 miles, enough to threaten the landing fleets at Gold and Omaha beaches.
According to a sign at the site, the batteries were made of "layers of earth, on an inclined plan, [which] rested on the...sidewalls. They were designed to cushion against bomb impacts, to prevent it from tipping over in the event of a near miss, and to conceal the blockhouses."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4eab2c44-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8c22ae9adbbefec75d4dd9477b5c414b/Lo-Front_of_targeting_station.jpg
This is the range-finding post for the Longues-sur-Mer batteries. It was located 300 yards in front of the batteries, on the edge of the cliff, and it was protected by machine-gun nests, as well as "Tobruks"--concrete niches mounted with a weapon or tank turret, according to the sign--mines, and barbed wire. The post was outfitted with a telemetric aiming device to help the crew reach their targets accurately.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/26/4ea34d94-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9dc637e1b16ad1456aa5dc6b1c482305/Lo-Back_of_battery_rubble.jpg
According to the sign at the Longues-sur-Mer site, overnight on June 5 and into June 6, the Allies fired a thousand tons of bombs at the Longues-sur-Mer batteries, but made little ground there.
Early on June 6, the battery became engaged in a duel with the American cruiser Arkansas and two French ships. The battery "stopped firing, then trained its guns on the...headquarters of the 3rd Infantry, which was forced to [back off]. The cruiser Ajax replied. Again the battery fell silent, until the afternoon, when it resumed firing on the beaches at Colleville [Omaha Beach] and Asnelles.
"Late in the evening, the Arkansas and [the French ships] knocked out the battery once and for all."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/27/4e9c763d-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5a7c11f7abeab185aaf40b3619d47f4a/PDH-point.jpg
This site, west of Omaha Beach, and east of Utah Beach, is Pointe-du-Hoc. The site was thought by the Germans to be safe from attack from the beach due to the cliffs atop which it sat, which had perfect views of both Omaha and Utah beaches. The Germans maintained long-range artillery here, and could reach both invasion beaches. Knocking out the guns at Pointe-du-Hoc was assumed by Allied command to be key to a successful invasion.
Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were chosen to attack Pointe-du-Hoc. Led by Lt. Col. James Rudder, 225 Rangers were assigned the task of landing on the beach, climbing the cliffs, and taking out the guns.
A navigation error led the Rangers to land three miles away, delaying them and costing them the element of surprise. And "despite rigorous Allied aerial and naval bombardments, the [Germans] remained and desperately attempted to ward off the the attackers with grenades and small arms fire," reads a sign at Pointe-du-Hoc. Eventually, however, the Rangers, using specially designed climbing equipment, reached the top.
"Upon reaching the top they found only empty gun emplacements among the craters of the preinvasion bombardments. The force then gradually advanced inland where two Rangers spotted the well-camouflaged 155mm gun battery, now positioned south of the point and sitting mysteriously silent. With the enemy gun crews close by, the two men employed thermite grenades and destroyed the guns. At the end of the day, [Col.] Rudder sent a message to V Corps saying, 'Located Pointe-du-Hoc--mission accomplished--need ammunition and reinforcement--many casualties.'"
Indeed, of the original 225-man attack force, just 90 combat-effective men remained after the attack.

Here, we see one of Eurotunnel's own locomotives emerging from the tunnel, a view that is not available to the public. 

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fd36e38-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dde1359da567116c08a3e096bee16607/Going_into_Eurotunnel_from_cab.jpg
As part of Road Trip 2011, CNET got a ride in the cab of a passenger vehicle train heading through the Eurotunnel. Here, we see the entrance to the tunnel--actually, both tunnels, including the one that carries trains from north to south, and the other, through which trains go south to north, just before entering from the France side.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fcee240-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5b09626d17cb4c81c2a334ee09f18cae/Train_driver.jpg
This is Eurotunnel train driver Tracy, smiling as she makes her way deep into the darkness of the 31-mile-long tunnel between France and England.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fc9e460-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f5455e24715da6c6fb64a87dd6c26320/Train_Speed_indicator.jpg
Eurotunnel train drivers have their maximum speed dictated by operators in the railway control center, either on the UK side of the tunnel or the France side. Generally, non-Eurostar trains have a maximum speed of 140 kilometers--87 miles--an hour. Eurostar trains are allowed to travel up to 160 kilometers--99 miles--an hour. Here, we see that Tracy's train is going 138 kilometers--86 miles--an hour.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fc2b519-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1ec2dcfc1fd71500dbe79ee3de2e0a0d/TCO-The_whole_thing_2.jpg
At the Eurotunnel's railway control center (RCC), operators can monitor every train that goes through either of the two tunnels that travel between England and France on the largest real-time optical control board in the world. Here, we see the entire board, known as the TCO, in the RCC on the UK side of the tunnel. There is a second RCC on the France side with an identical TCO.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fbc645e-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a4ecb323cd3423e655971bbe045ef2cf/TCO_-_French_terminal_side.jpg
This is the optical real-time control board that allows operators in the Eurotunnel's railway control center to monitor all train traffic through the side-by-side tunnels between France and England. On this side of the board, we see the section that corresponds with the giant Calais, France-based terminal from which huge numbers of trains carrying everything from passenger cars to buses to cargo trucks depart each day. Each of the main green lines represents a track and the 4- or 5-digit numbers correspond to a specific train. If the number begins with a "7" it means it's a train carrying trucks and cargo. The all-digital board updates in real-time.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fb69471-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/894db990224e54efc1157a8555221887/7365_1.jpg
In the middle left of this image, we see a yellow line with the number "7365." This corresponds to the length of a truck-carrying train that is heading from France to the UK.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fab3d01-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/852d6f98be837acf824918304661352a/Space_and_time.jpg
This is a computer-based graph that shows the progress of any train in either of the two tunnels in space and time. The train's time of departure is on the X axis, and its place in the tunnel--designated by a code--is on the Y axis.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4fa2c915-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/352daa5f6027ad3fe285dad5db778c18/Tunnels_empty.jpg
Here we see the two tunnels--on the France side--with no trains passing through. Moments later, a truck train emerges having just completed the journey from England.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f9a05e4-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3981b9f6451f98d18c31a7e7e9fc80b8/Tunnels_trucks_coming_out.jpg
Having just emerged from the tunnel, this train is carrying trucks and other heavy equipment.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f921852-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/47258d4345309193e15849cfd3da7580/Tunnel_illustration.jpg
This illustration shows the configuration of the Eurotunnel--its two main tunnels, as well as its service tunnel, ventilation system, and cross passages.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f8be16a-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/39263ba335586aa56e25957e8ec7d05f/Photo_of_tunnel.jpg
This is a Eurotunnel photograph of the interior of one of the tunnels.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f8481cd-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/04e7da6f32d3e1d08ab02ef28cac43ce/Walking_into_service_tunnel.jpg
Here, we see two Eurotunnel employees, including Jean-Luc Pochet (left), the manager of the service tunnel infrastructure, walking into the service tunnel from the France side. The service tunnel allows maintenance and other official vehicles to drive through, as well as being the escape route passengers would enter if there was an emergency in either of the train tunnels. An overpressure system built into the infrastructure is designed to pull smoke out of the main tunnels, allowing passengers to escape a fire without the danger of smoke inhalation.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f7e32d2-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2d68d33f0719f94a6ba1bcd1091f3770/Service_tunnel_fire_door_closing.jpg
Here, we see one of the fire doors that are located throughout the service tunnel closing. The doors are designed to isolate a fire if one should break out, as well as to maintain the proper pressure in the tunnels.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f78368b-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/84336492be3371bb8d1abe4d4a426acb/Inside_service_tunnel.jpg
This is a view of the Eurotunnel service tunnel.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f70688b-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/cd8fdcecafe65e08d68572fe27dee99c/Locomotive_being_retrofitted.jpg
Eurotunnel maintains a fleet of 57 locomotives and more than 900 wagons. The company is in the process of upgrading many of the locomotives from 5.6 megawatts to 7 megawatts because of increased passenger and freight traffic through the tunnels between France and the UK. It is also being done in anticipation of further increases in traffic due to the London Olympics being held in 2012.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f67cfb3-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/cd59c493f9804c3b62335bd62439755e/Tunnel_shuttle.jpg
This is one of the shuttle vehicles that ferry people through the service tunnel. The vehicles drive along a magnetic line that keeps them on a straight line inside the tunnel. Otherwise, drivers would have trouble staying on a straight line.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f605cc7-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/72d4df2dd30b25f2295a842e6022b169/Locomotive_on_blocks.jpg
Part of the upgrading process for the locomotives involves replacing the complex equipment underneath the train, including air conditioning, ventilation, and more. These systems are entirely unique to Eurotunnel's trains, and are said by the company to be among the most sophisticated installed on any trains anywhere in the world. Here we see one of the locomotives lifted up for its retrofit.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f593037-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/95e2ad4764afe2dd80831acf63fa5b44/Fire_door_and_two_hose_fittings.jpg
This is a fire door in one of the passageways between the two main tunnels. On the lower left of the door, you can also see hose fittings for fire crews from both the UK and France. This is so the first crew that arrives, whichever country they come from, can attach their hoses--which are different in each country.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f4ea6d5-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2687a797f7f6aabaa53876966e7a57a1/Interior_passenger_carriage.jpg
This is a look into an empty Eurotunnel passenger car wagon. Each wagon can hold several cars, and during the ride between the Continent and the UK, passengers can get out of the cars and relax in comfort. The wagons can hold buses, RVs, cars, and other passenger vehicles, even those that are taller than normal cars.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f4895bb-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4264e7cfb1978942be2718eb447e0e7e/Bus_coming_off.jpg
Here we see a bus emerging from one of the passenger vehicle wagons on the UK side of the Chunnel.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f4141fc-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/db74ee4ffe3d7ddae580fb09ef5715db/Long_trains_in_shop.jpg
Eurotunnel maintains what it says is the largest train maintenance shop in Europe. While much of the work that goes on there is done on individual locomotives or wagons, there is a section of the shop that is long enough to hold entire trains, such as the two seen here.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f3c2d38-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5e92ff19833f34bc70fd25629ce76ff3/Many_axles.jpg
Just outside of the maintenance shop, we see many train axles lined up for various purposes.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f3505ca-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/50f92ac0646c5ac39fa989f0c637458c/Passenger_carriage_inside.jpg
Here, we see a close-up view of the interior of one of the passenger-car wagons.

Here we see a train axle being lifted by a crane and being carried to where it will be worked on or re-attached to a train wagon or locomotive.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f1eadbe-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f8e4e04c28a57ece48077e2eca65561b/Carriage_lifted_up.jpg
Here we see a Eurotunnel wagon lifted off the ground so that crews can work on the complex equipment located underneath.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/29/4f10e268-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac9d68a900277dc2d2cc89a6e9f8e67e/New_wheel.jpg
This is a new wheel attached to a train axle at the Eurotunnel maintenance shop in Calais, France.

This is one of two gigantic shafts at either end of the Eurotunnel that houses piping for ventilation, water for firefighting, and cooling. The equipment is located at the top of the shafts, which on the France side is about 3 kilometers north of the entrance to the tunnel. The shaft is 187 feet wide, and 131 feet tall, big enough, it is said, to fit the entire Arc de Triomphe.

This is an Airedale that is in the back of a car on a Eurotunnel passenger-car wagon. Passengers are able to carry pets back and forth between France and the UK, so long as they acquire a "passport" for their animal.

Today, it is still very much a working studio, and artists from all over the world come to record and mix there. CNET got a chance to visit and see some of the most impressive studio rooms and equipment in the industry. Including a microphone that both McCartney and Lennon often sung into.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/50aa8905-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fe7c9d03a9d2d758d9decde4041df2c0/Beatles_4-track.jpg
Throughout Abbey Road Studios, there is recording and mixing equipment everywhere. And since the studios have been used by everyone and anyone in the industry for nearly eight decades, you never know what you'll run into. In one hallway, placed unceremoniously against a wall, this four-track recorder sits in relative obscurity. Until you find out that it was used to record many of The Beatles' songs.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/50a79b90-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2fbb13eca496ca2b1e3acdcb877d1714/Beatles_mike_held_by_Lester.jpg
Lester Smith oversees Abbey Road Studios' collection of hundreds of microphones. Stacked on several sets of shelves are case after case of them, most of which are still used today, despite--or perhaps because of, their age. 
Here, Smith proudly displays a 1950s-era vocal microphone used frequently by The Beatles. "I can happily say that both John and Paul used this same mic," Smith said.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/50a117c5-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d93c7be429aa6dccc97f8b21c913af41/Zebra_crossing_DT.jpg
In the United States, we call this a crosswalk. In London, it's a zebra crossing. Either way, this one is perhaps the most famous in the world, made so by The Beatles on the cover of their "Abbey Road" album. Today, fans of the band from all over the world come to show their respects by posing for pictures in the crossing.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/509d260c-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c66b3979f1bd3d2ae46b39629a8dbee1/Studio_2.jpg
This is the famed Studio 2, a large recording room considered a "mecca" by many in the music business because it's where The Beatles made the majority of their songs. All told, the band recorded more than 90 percent of their songs at Abbey Road Studios, with most of those being done in Studio 2.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/50971bb2-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/168a224064a40457f37680b240517488/Studio_2_from_floor.jpg
This is a view of Studio 2 taken from floor level.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/508fb685-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9d850297e89a9cc45f9dce4630f2d9b2/Lady_Madonna_piano.jpg
In a corner of Studio 2, this is the "Lady Madonna piano," which Paul McCartney played in The Beatles song of the same name. Recently, McCartney surprised people working in a nearby studio room by showing up and pounding out "Lady Madonna" on the piano, something that the sign on it clearly says is not supposed to be done.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/5089477d-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8c61caa2a7e5fe33495f7695332678fb/Ribbon_mike-RM1B_1930s.jpg
According to Lester Smith, this is an original ribbon microphone from the mid-1930s that has been a mainstay for Abbey Road Studios ever since. It is used on many film scoring sessions, as well as many orchestral recordings.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/507ee440-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/66ad684c4d8b3616f433c16182a2b70b/Studio_1_mixing_board.jpg
This is the mixing console for Abbey Road Studio's Studio 1. According to sound engineer Simon Rhodes, the studio works with the manufacturers of equipment like this to ensure that it gets the exact machines it needs. A console like this Neve 88RS costs about $800,000. Although digital is all the rage in music, these consoles are strictly analog due to the fact that for professionals like those at Abbey Road, digital is not yet up to the quality standards demanded by clients who pay a lot for the privilege of working there.

This is one of the most famous street signs in Europe.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/506a3850-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/182e961e43e54271672dd073e9240a1b/Studio_1_patch_bay.jpg
This is the patch bay in Studio 1. Usually, this would have so many wires plugged into it--bringing sounds in or out of the mixing board--that it would look like a "swirling mass of snakes," said Rhodes.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/5064ba7e-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8a21823969891eadba74e01521c35758/Studio_1.jpg
This is Studio 1, which has a 40-foot-high ceiling and is used extensively for the recording of film scores and orchestral pieces.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/505b9fa0-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fb33e43214b5cbbdad7f0c878a309a04/Studio_3.jpg
This is Abbey Road Studios' Studio 3, a longtime popular room. In here, Pink Floyd recorded "The Dark Side of the Moon," and more recently, Lady Gaga made "Born this Way."

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/50549e34-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f66a8b60809457876052e9e96415dcf1/Toy_cupboard_shelves_of_equipment.jpg
This is the "toy cupboard" at Abbey Road Studios, where hundreds of pieces of "outboard" equipment are stored and regularly shuffled in and out of recording sessions.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/06/30/504dbacd-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac59313f63eb47b69467fcab605c9fdc/Very_early_mastering_EQ.jpg
This is a "very early" mastering EQ, according to Rhodes. "It's quite hysterical what's in this cupboard if you appreciate it," he said.

On the right is an M50, and 1950s-era microphone made by the Neumann company, and on the left is a later version of the same mike, a TL M50 that's about 20 years old. The newer model employs transistors to make sound as high quality as its predecessor, but while the newer model has great sound, Rhodes said it's not quite up to the same standards.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/03/20/7e50deef-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/cbd01391e563658589ff607ace253691/Colossus_rebuild_1.jpg
This is a rebuild of the famous Colossus Mark 2 machine (left) that finally allowed the code breakers to quickly and efficiently break the high command's ciphers. The original Colossus was so secret that after the war was over, it was broken apart and its components destroyed. But because there were 11 surviving pictures of the machine, Bletchley Park museum personnel have been able to build a fully working reconstruction, and visitors to the National Museum of Computing here can see the new Colossus for themselves. 

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2010/08/05/7e417cd8-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6a84899b7c8f954c8d2d743d0b1ffbf7/Enigma.jpg
This is an Enigma machine, from the collection of the National Cryptologic Museum in Fort Meade, Md.--the museum of the U.S. National Security Agency.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7e31eb6c-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a98151eb6a4e3075d55d006570e33f6c/Colossus_body_close-up.jpg
To tackle the job of quickly analyzing intercepted German high command messages, leaders at Bletchley Park "called in the help of Tommy Flowers, a brilliant Post Office Electronics Engineer," the museum's Web site reads. "Flowers went on to design and build Colossus, a much faster and more reliable machine that used 1,500 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). The first Colossus machine arrived at Bletchley in December 1943. This was the world's first practical electronic digital information processing machine--a forerunner of today's computers.
The Germans used a "high security teleprinter cypher machine to enable them to communicate by radio in complete secrecy," writes Bletchley Park scientist Tony Sale on his Codes and Ciphers Web site. It was called Lorenz, and this device "had to be cracked by carrying out complex statistical analyses on the intercepted messages," the Bletchley Park museum site reads. "Colossus could read paper tape at 5,000 characters per second and the paper tape in its wheels traveled at 30 miles per hour. This meant that the huge amount of mathematical work that needed to be done could be carried out in hours, rather than weeks."
This is a closeup of the Colossus rebuild at Bletchley Park today.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7e2b6b76-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/04814ba907dae9de9d5f339530a07ea8/Colossus_tubes-valves.jpg
This is a closeup of some of the 1,500 vacuum tubes used to do the work on Colossus. The machine was built entirely from off-the-shelf Post Office machinery parts.

A look at the rear side of Colossus. The rebuild at the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park is a fully functional machine that can decrypt Lorenz codes on demand.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2010/08/05/7e19b914-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f5050f763d1ac6df362145b4154979f4/Operational_rotors.jpg
These are the operational rotors of Enigma. According to the National Cyptologic Museum in Fort Meade, Md., "The German military issued extra rotors with each machine--two for Army and Air Force machines and four for Navy. Each rotor was wired differently and identified with a Roman numeral. Setting up a communications net involved selecting the rotors for the day and placing them in the machine in the proper left-to-right order."

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7e120a6c-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/221a70978c1af058c5f927ca09a6f487/Colossus_ticker_tape_reader.jpg
This is a device attached to Colossus that constantly read characters back into the machine--because Colossus had no on-board storage. Instead, the tape that was produced by teams at other machines was continuously read back into Colossus until it had the entire message.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7e06bb15-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b6fb5aaca8cce64f24f2a391404e8bd6/Photo_original_Colossus.jpg
The rebuild of Colossus was possible because although the original machine was nearly destroyed, there were at least 11 surviving photographs of it with which to base the reconstruction project on.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7dfcbf02-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4435293430e5d5b8238fd15dbad8f2b9/Early_intercept_machine.jpg
This is an earlier version of an intercept machine, which captured the Germans' communications and put out a ticker tape that was then read and its contents input into a second machine, called a "Tunny," for deciphering.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7df31ce1-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/14ced8b927f26d705b86c73b56cb1c7f/HR_Undulator.jpg
This device converted the coded messages captured by the intercept machine into a ticker tape that was then read and its contents typed into a Tunny machine.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7ded8121-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/11aa8ac4f0d9d833f1951b30ed020f35/HR_Tunny_machines.jpg
At Bletchley Park during World War II, groups of women would take the ticker tape containing the coded German messages and type the codes into these Tunny machines. The Tunnys would then convert the coded message into a new ticker tape that would then be put through a bombe machine and analyzed.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7de50534-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/46df026a39c0bf772a229931597892da/HR_ticker_tape_reader.jpg
This is part of the Heath Robinson, a successor to the Colossus. It was not successful because it tended to shred the ticker tape as it fed it through its systems. It was called Heath Robinson because it was considered a crazy invention, something that was regularly a part of a 1940s-era cartoon by that name.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7ddb86db-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c769b6583418d1b091fa999609615852/Turing_office.jpg
This is a re-creation of Alan Turing's office in Hut 8 at Bletchley Park. From this office, Turing directed efforts to break the German high command's codes and in the process may have helped shave two years off World War II.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7dd32a79-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1260c2c8368157b770fa6aa59ec5fb26/HR_Pin_board.jpg
This is a pin board that's part of the Heath Robinson. 
Though its many "huts" and "blocks" look rundown and somewhat decrepit today, Bletchley Park was in its day the world's first purpose-built computing center, built specifically to break the Germans' codes and help the Allies defeat the Germans and win World War II.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7dcbf0a4-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/882d24414ab3a6ca33b26516de03549f/HR_test_run_code_decypher.jpg
This is a test run of the deciphering capabilities of the reconstructed and fully working machines at the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.

This is the key that the women working the Tunny machines would use to input the Lorenz codes after they'd come off the undulators at the intercept machines.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2010/08/05/7db0fdb7-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1b9668803b0af7e28a9f98f64f2befe8/Tunny.jpg
This is a German tunny machine, displayed at the National Cryptologic Museum in Fort Meade, Md. A cryptographic typewriter, the tunny offered encryption and decryption, meaning that an operator could type in plain text and get encoded text out. They were built to handle large amounts of text at high speeds. An early version of these machines was called "Swordfish," and, learning that, the Americans and the British began to give fish nicknames to various versions of the machine. 
It is a Schlusselzusatz 40 (SZ40), made by the German company Lorenz and was used by the German Army for high-level communications. "It provided on-line encryption and decryption of messages and was capable of handling large volumes of traffic at high speed," according to the National Cryptologic Museum. "The Tunny depended on wheels for its encryption/decryption, but unlike Enigma, it did not substitute letters, but instead encrypted elements of the electrically generated 'Baudot Code' used in normal telegraphic transmissions."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2010/08/05/7da5be8a-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fe168e1eda8653ae1d2d804d592c1beb/Cryptanalytic_Bombe.jpg
This is a U.S. Navy cryptanalytic bombe. Bletchley Park analysts worked on British-built bombes.
The machines "worked primarily against the German Navy's four-rotor Enigmas. Without the proper settings, the encrypted messages were virtually unbreakable," according to the National Cryptologic Museum. "The bombes took only 20 minutes to complete a run, testing each of the 456,976 possible rotor settings within one wheel order. Different bombes tried different wheel orders, and one of them would have had the final correct settings. When the various U-boat settings were found for the day, the bombe could be switched over to work on the German Army and Air Force three-rotor messages."

This is George the robot, built by Tony Sale, a vintage computer specialist who works at and is the original curator or the Bletchley Park Museum and who maintains the Web site Codes and Ciphers. 
Sale built George in 1950, and it was the world's first working, walking humanoid, according to Sale. At the time, Sale and George were filmed for British TV, and more recently, when the creators of the "Wallace and Gromit" movies saw the broadcast, they asked for--and received--permission to include George in one of their films.

Built in 1895, this is the "Millionaire," made by Switzerland's H.W. Egll. It was the first calculating machine in history that was capable of doing multiplication instead of just doing repeated addition. Machines like this were common in the insurance industry until the 1930s, according to the museum.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7d842674-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b38a5f4074c56b3e82e49b47b23a4900/TR-48.jpg
This is the TR-48, an early analog computer. To solve a problem, the machine creates "a mathematical model of a problem," according to the museum, "then [plug in] an electronic circuit which simulates the system represented by the mathematical model.
"This is achieved by techniques such as summing, integrating, and applying other functions to create gradually changing voltages within the machine."

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7d7b8086-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/bee4c6ef859453f77407c0fc15e5d081/PDP11.jpg
This is a PDP 11/34, built in 1976 by Digital Equipment Corporation. It was a 16-bit minicomputer that ran on a single bus system called Unibus.
"The usage of a single bus was quite a departure in terms of computer technology," according to the museum, "as many minicomputers at that time had a separate dedicated I/O bus. The designers at DEC could do without this separate bus by mapping all of the I/O requirements to addresses in memory so that no specialized I/O instructions were needed.
The PDP-11 could use several different kinds of peripherals, such as a disk drive that had as much as 2.5 megabytes of storage space. As well, it had dual 8-inch disk drives that could each store 256 kilobytes of information. It also had a tape drive. This version of the computer "is running the RT-11 single-user real-time operating system," according to the museum.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/03/7d5839d3-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d33d2e23bd3117a713ead3b0f59f3599/Air_Traffic_control_radar.jpg
This is an air traffic control radar station, from 1978, that was once used at London's ATC center near the famous Heathrow airport.
"Along with 30 similar stations, they were manned by the controllers responsible for flights in and out of London Heathrow--the busiest international airport in the world," according to the museum.
"Two PDP11 computers control each desk...One is responsible for processing radar data and the other for controlling the display."
Deployed in the 1970s, it was amazingly only retired in 2008.

Venice Flood Control Project
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/51608f66-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c3e07952a89ac538cc6ba5c62621a572/Venice_inlets.jpg
This image shows the Venice Lagoon and the three inlets that allow shipping traffic in and out, but through which storm surges have regularly flooded Venice. The gate systems of the Mose project will be installed at the three inlets.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/51577bbb-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0a4ba8315522212f54d197abf7203f5d/Inlet_diagram.jpg
This diagram explains the new infrastructure that is being installed at each of the three inlets of the Venice Lagoon. A total of 78 large gates will be installed in four rows, hopefully by 2014, at the three inlets--two sets totaling 41 gates at the Lido inlet, 19 at the Malamocco inlet, and 18 at the Chioggia inlet.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/5152aa3b-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/334c7c02cceb96024f14c9d15e4a9c8d/Gate_diagram.jpg
This illustration explains the five major elements of each of the gates. When needed, the gates will rise between 40 and 42 degrees from the hinge seen in this image in order to protect the interior of the lagoon from the seas. The gates will be opened only in groups of threes in order to keep too much water from flooding through the other inlets.
In this illustration, the Adriatic Sea is on the right side, and the Venice Lagoon on the left. The gates are intended to maintain a lower water level in the lagoon than in the Adriatic.
The thickness of the gates will vary from inlet to inlet, from 11.8 feet to 16.4 feet. The lengths will also vary depending on the depth of the canals where they are located, from 60.7 feet to 95.8 feet. But all the gates will be 65.6 feet wide.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/514e8ed8-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/de20b7d3bd61383ce411fc1485917f81/Gate_in_action.jpg
In this illustration, we can see one of the gates as it will look when it is in use. Today, the Consorzio Venezia Nuovo's construction contractors are working on building the many caissons that will house the gates, and the gates themselves will be built prior to the planned 2014 debut of the Mose project. When needed, the gates should be able to be opened in about 45 minutes, and closed in about the same amount of time.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/5148c9db-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b63d61a434ebf700b0f09988914048b6/Gate_function.jpg
This illustration explains the basics of how the gates are intended to work. The gates, which are hollow, will rise up at their hinges from the caissons on which they are installed under water. According to a document from the Consorzio Venezia Nuova, "When a high tide is forecast, compressed air is pumped into the gates to empty them of water, causing them to rise above the surface and create a continuous barrier dividing the sea and the lagoon for the time necessary. Small craft harbors connected to locks allow vessels to enter the lagoon when the barriers are raised--small locks for pleasure and fishing boats at Lido and Chioggia and at Malamocco, a lock for large ships heading for the port."

While the caissons--otherwise known as basements--that will house most of the gates are being constructed away from where they will be installed, that's not the case at the Lido inlet. There, because there is enough space to build them, they will be constructed in place.
In order to do that, the area around the caissons was drained of water, a stone system placed underneath to protect the bed of the caisson, and then the whole thing reinforced with a system of piles to avoid the collapse of the bed. Then, at Lido, the caissons were built on top of this system.
Here we see one of the Lido caissons under construction. It will hold three gates, each of which will eventually be installed on top of it and connected with special hinges.
The plan is that in the spring of 2012, all the water will be put back into this section, and this caisson and those around it will all be back underwater.

Just alongside the Malamocco inlet, a huge construction site has been set up for the building of 18 of the caissons. They will be made at the site, and then launched into the water via a special system called the Syncrolift. The caissons will then be towed into place nearby.
All 18 of the Malamocco caissons are being constructed at the same time, although according to a very specific plan, and not at the same pace. Here we see a row of caissons that are under construction.

This is at the Lido site, and we see a curving row of installed caissons, each of which will house three gates.

This is an aerial view of the caisson construction going on at the Malamocco site. What this picture shows is that the caissons, while constructed of steel and concrete, have large hollow spaces in them that will allow them to be buoyant when launched into the water before being sunk into place at the nearby Malamocco inlet.

This is an aerial view of the Malamocco inlet (in the foreground) and the Malamocco caisson construction site (on the left). The caissons are being built there and will be launched from the Syncrolift and towed into place in the inlet. Later, the gates will be installed atop the caissons.

In this archival photograph, we see Venice underneath flood waters. The city is being flooded up to five times each year, and the Mose project is intended to protect the city from the rising tides that threaten the city's well-being.

Each of the caissons will be launched into the water via the Syncrolift. In order to get to the Syncrolift, however, they must first be rolled into place on specially designed tracks. And they will be placed on top of 84 large trolleys. Here we see a long row of the trolleys, each of which has its own hydraulic piston jack that is used to support some of the massive amount of weight of the caisson.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/510687f9-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5bea7e1e41fd4f034c6b9e5fdc1134e1/2nd_site_trolley_close_up.jpg
This is a close-up of one of the 84 trolleys that will be used to roll each of the caissons into place at the Syncrolift.

These are the tracks on which the caissons will be rolled into place at the Syncrolift. The tolerances for the construction of the tracks was minuscule--a fraction of a millimeter--because there was almost no room for error in ensuring that the caissons are moved totally straight toward the Syncrolift.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/50fbe1c0-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/13304e4b9dc802fdb3746da20a9a873e/2nd_site_trolleys_in_front.jpg
Here, we see a trolley for each of the tracks underneath one of the caissons. There is an extremely delicate plan in place for moving each one of the caissons into position to be rolled onto the Syncrolift. It involves sliding them forward and to the side from their construction places. When moving to the side, each trolley will lower its jack, rotate 90 degrees, and then raise its jack, one trolley at a time. This is expected to be a very slow, laborious process.

This is an aerial view of the Syncrolift. You can see how it is at the end of the artificial pier on which the caissons are being constructed. There is one row of caissons that is lined up directly with the Syncrolift. But two rows are to the side, and the caissons being made there will have to be moved to the side using the process described in the previous caption.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/10/50dfc681-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/cb9d097b5cf6f3a5c6bc5d98682fa172/1st_site_Caisson_with_tunnels.jpg
Each caisson is being built with two tunnels inside that will house all kinds of electric and mechanical systems, and which will be waterproofed so that people can operate inside of them.

These are a matching pair of the connectors that will join the gates with the caissons. Three of these connectors will be used for each gate.

Here, we see a bin of the tweezers that go in just about every one of those models.

This is one of the original models of Swiss Army Knife, from 1891. Made by the company's founder, Karl Elsener, it was a commission to the Swiss government to make knives for every one of the country's soldiers. Though it didn't have the now-famous logo, and Elsener's company wasn't yet called Victorinox--that would come years later, in honor of his mother, Victoria, and because of the French word "inox," which means stainless steel--the knife is recognizable as the predecessor of what nearly everyone has today. The Swiss government still purchases a knife for all its soldiers from the company, and there have been just eight different models since 1891 for the Swiss military, with the most recent being released in 2008.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/11/528c1d5f-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/358f60ae1a78b2912a6d36e657b7d6b5/Elsener.jpg
At the base of the main blade of this original soldier's Swiss Army Knife, you can see that prior to being named Victorinox, Karl Elsener's company took his family name.

Elsener wanted to make an official Swiss Army Knife for officers as well, and began producing them. But the Swiss government decided that officers would still have the soldier's knife they got when they joined the Army and decided not to give Elsener the contract. Still, the company produced officer's knives for years, and this is one from 1931.

As blades for various models of Victorinox knives come off a stamping machine, they can be pulled from a bin using this rake so that workers don't cut their hands.

This wheel feeds strips of aluminum into a stamping machine in order to make the dividers that go between the different tools in a Swiss Army Knife. The dividers are aluminum in order to save weight, but the tools are generally made from stainless steel.

With these five knives, you can see the long history of Swiss Army Knives played out. They include the original official soldier's knife from 1891 in the lower right; the latest model, from 2008, in the upper right; a previous model, from 1968, in the upper left; an officer's knife, from 1931, in the upper right; and a more recent version of one of the standard, red knives in the center.

Here, a worker puts spindles of small standard Swiss Army Knife blades on a conveyor in order to put them through a furnace that will subject them to temperatures of 1,050 degrees Celsius in order to harden the stainless steel, making it possible for the blades to last for decades rather than begin to fall apart nearly immediately.

After being stamped, many of these Swiss Army Knife leather tools still have small pieces of metal that haven't fallen out. So the tools are put on a machine that shakes them violently, a process that ejects the small pieces.

After being stamped, the blades are still rough. So they are placed in these machines, along with artificial ceramic stones and some water, where they are polished for between five and eight hours, after which the tops of the blades come out smooth.

This august building used to house the Heineken brewery--the main brewery is now located elsewhere--but the company has maintained it as a museum and homage to its 147 years of beer-making.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c5638d58-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f9ba11cb169f942c5fb7fed2782da6a9/Mr_Heineken.jpg
According to information provided by the Heineken Experience, "Gerard Adriaan Heineken founded Heineken &amp; Co. on [February 15, 1864] at the young age of 22. Thus began a proud family tradition of brewing premium-quality beer. Not only did Adriaan express a great deal of fortitude and entrepreneurship in founding the Heineken Brewery, he did it with an overwhelming devotion to provide the finest product possible."

Throughout the old Heineken brewery, you can see old posters and signage for the brand.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c5557448-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7303bd091959ca35eaa5de05337d391d/Storage_silos.jpg
This is one of 15 large storage silos that are located in the old Heineken brewery and that are as much as 65 feet tall. "They were used to store malted barley for crafting and brewing Heineken," a sign about the silos reads. "Historically, the barley arrived by ship via the canal across the street and was transferred to the top of the building directly into these historic silos. The brewing process went on for 24 hours a day with up to six brews a day."
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c54d728e-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/508b75a65175316b3e580584cde5f340/Original_kettle.jpg
This is one of the four original Heineken brewery copper kettles. They were installed in 1913, and in 1956, Heineken added four additional kettles.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c547fc64-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ae2a427e9a0c2a26ba15b80a484d9fdc/Original_copper_kettles.jpg
These are the four additional copper kettles Heineken installed in 1956.

Here we see an example of wort used in the brewing of Heineken beer. It is water and barley that is heated and filtered.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c533f680-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b0dad2a86a8122b6cad2125c695bf2a8/Fermentation_tank.jpg
This is a stainless steel fermentation tank that was installed in the Heineken brewery in the 1960s. "The new beer was transferred into these tanks along with Heineken's famous 'A' yeast," reads a sign about the tanks, "and allowed to ferment for up to three weeks before it was bottled."

According to the Heineken Experience, "Horses have always been a significant part of Heineken.... From the founding of the Heineken Brewery in 1864 until the beginning of the 1960s, barrels of beer were delivered to local cafes and establishments in Amsterdam by horse and cart."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c51fb18f-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/bf403ed127b74fd106143ee84b975e0b/Freddy_the_horse.jpg
This is Freddy, one of the horses that Heineken still keeps in a stable inside its old brewery.

This Heineken bottle was a new design for the Dutch market in 1939.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c509effe-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b18c24ace55115b06560c27f7672b7c1/Different_Heineken_bottles.jpg
These are four Heineken bottles that were introduced over the years. On the left is the first bottle used for export to the United States, in 1933. Second from left is the "Apollinaris" bottle, from 1948, which was the same kind used when Heineken first bottled its own beer, starting in 1931 (previously, bottling had been done by independent companies). Second from the right is the company's general export bottle, from 1970. And on the right is the first Heineken longneck bottle, from 1996.

According to a sign at the Heineken Experience, "After seeing the poverty on the island of Curacao in 1960, Alfred Heineken came up with a solution for sustainable housing. He invited acclaimed Dutch architect John Habraken to design the World Bottle, or 'Wobo,' as it soon became known. Freddy [Heineken] referred to it as a 'brick that holds beer.' The empty Wobo could be used to build affordable houses.
"The Heineken Wobo went through several design processes with one aim in mind--to design a bottle that was interlocking and self-aligning. A final design was achieved and two sizes--350 and 500mm--were manufactured. The bottle, however, never went beyond a prototype."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c4f1dd99-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/bd8a4af47f357b8e3db75b464d2fb695/Logos.jpg
These are several Heineken logos from the company's 147-year-long history.

According to Heineken, the red star featured on all the company's beer labels can be traced back to the 14th century "and is one of the most ancient and mysterious symbols in the history of beer making. It is said that medieval brewers hung the enduring symbol of the star over their vats to protect the brew and guarantee its quality. The protective powers of the five-point star symbolized earth, fire, wind, and water, with the fifth star point representing the unknown element that the brewers believed was 'magic.'"
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c4df41e2-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3b9c87975239c2ec04a40fcb8a17c140/Bottle_wash.jpg
Although Heineken is no longer brewed in the old Heineken brewery that now houses the Heineken Experience, there is a scaled down bottling system that is used to demonstrate the process.
This is the first step, the bottle wash.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c4d8a9fb-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7d7f59a5257d2661a582813564e2eb11/Bottle_test_and_bottle_filling.jpg
Next comes a bottle test, and then the filling of the bottles.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c4cbef4b-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0932f7c9547a97dff332b8fba275a562/Bottle_crowning.jpg
After that, the caps are added, or the bottles are "crowned."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/12/c4c4c4e9-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/12e0e8d318a3011f9a99823c301e9334/Label_application.jpg
Next, the Heineken labels are added.

Finally, the bottles are inspected, and then sent off for packaging.

Heineken has been making beer since 1864, and has used a lot of different kinds of bottles. These are two of the most unusual, and newest: The Paco, from 2004, which was "designed for a fun night out on the town...an award-winning, minimalist, and sleek molded aluminum design," and the Icone, from 2006, made from aluminum materials and designed by France's Ora-Ito.

This is the nose section of an A380 being built in what is known as Station 40, at the facility in Blagnac.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/14/53ad1cbb-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dc4f6a938c6bda4799ee6c4bb9435740/On_tarmac.jpg
Two A380s that have been fully assembled sit on the tarmac outside the final assembly factory in Blagnac, France. The planes have not yet had their carrier livery painted on--that will be done after they are flown to Hamburg, Germany, where the customers will pick up their new planes. The tails have been modified in this photograph so as not to reveal the planes' customers.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/14/53a3db03-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ebe7c98a7350b55727a779af962554d7/Nose_and_both_wings_wide.jpg
Seen from across the giant Airbus assembly facility near Toulouse, France, an A380 is being constructed at what is known as Station 40. The plane's major components--its fuselage, wings, tail, tail fins, and more--are joined together at one large station. It's a different system than the one used at rival Boeing, where planes move down a line to have their major components added.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/14/539e28b4-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3f9e03bea75e7eb55818d3891449c9a6/Wings_and_cranes.jpg
In the foreground of this photograph is an A380 wing resting just above the ground. In the background, we see another wing elevated. The one on the ground is being stored here for the next A380, while the one in the background is already part of one of the giant planes that is currently being built.
Above, on the ceiling, are two large cranes that are used to hoist major plane components, like these wings, into place.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/14/53946cd8-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/93aa26311d84b98770eed6d021cde1b0/Underneath_left_wing_assembly.jpg
Here, a view up at the left side wing of an A380 that is being assembled at Station 40.

In the background, we see the front section of an A380 that's currently being assembled. In the foreground, we see the two tires that will be part of the plane's front landing gear.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/14/537e9bec-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8586c23d1f5f277877be0f5a1d07908f/Landing_gear.jpg
This is the main part of an A380's front landing gear. The components are waiting to be added to a future A380.

The A380's wings are big enough that they can hold the plane's air conditioning packs. That, says Airbus, is an advantage over most other large planes because the packs don't have to be stored in the A380's belly fairing. That, in turn, means the plane's fuselage is more streamlined than it would otherwise be, reducing its drag.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/14/53628520-f0ed-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1706422bd950dec171bce2f34d53f358/Working_on_wing.jpg
An Airbus employee works on one of the A380's wings. You can see some of the air conditioning systems installed just on the inside of the hollow space of the wing.

After the major components of an A380 are joined together at Station 40, the plane is backed out of the assembly building and brought back in again at what is called Station 30. There, the plane has all its interior systems installed, as well as its engines added. Here, we see an A380 that is at Station 30.

This is the pylon for a left-side wing A380 engine. It is the only major A380 component that is actually made in Toulouse, France. While the plane is assembled there--actually, in nearby Blagnac--most of its components are built in Airbus facilities in England, Germany, and Spain.

These tracks in the floor allow the rear side of the jig to move as the assembly process requires. The front section of the jig--from the nose until the wings--is stationary, while the rear section can move on these tracks.

This A380, seen from the right side, is at Station 30, meaning it has already had all its exterior components added, and crews are now installing the plane's interior systems--hydraulics, avionics, wiring, doors, and cockpit.

Each A380 at Station 30 is hoisted about 1.5 meters off the ground to have its landing gear installed. Once the landing gear is joined with the plane, it can be lowered down to rest on its own weight. Here, we see one of the planes still hoisted off the ground.

And it makes for some funny pictures, too, such as here, where we see one of the three fuselage sections passing within feet of a sign for the local boulangerie, or bakery.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a7d29e3b-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0f682acf65d7ded3b7d34e0530fdb0b2/Attention_Convoi.jpg
The convoy began passing through Levignac at about 11:15 p.m. local time, and for about an hour before that, police made sure no cars were parked anywhere on the town's main street. Electronic sign boards were put up alerting anyone who didn't already know that the A380 convoy would soon be coming through.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a7cb3d2a-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9998b83d4adf4b0cbcc45163470af691/First_wing_section_across_intersection.jpg
The first piece of plane to pass through Levignac while I was there was one of the A380's wings. Actually, Airbus routinely ships the wings for the next A380 with the convoy, so the wing seen here will not be used in the assembly of the same airplane that's getting the other major components. Still, the wing was part of the parade, and in this photograph, you can see that it's long enough to stretch more than across an intersection.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a7c5d204-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2e4cb304e2dbce64d206584eb5864b67/First_wing_section_arrives.jpg
The first wing of the convoy arrives in Levignac.

The A380 convoy provides the people of Levignac the opportunity for a nighttime party. Before the components began passing through town, hundreds of people lined the streets, many with wine and other drinks in hand.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a7b80c69-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6b67e3482b055feee38a7f944bf6e438/Wingtip--convoi_exceptionnel.jpg
The truck carrying this wing has a sign on it that says it all: "Convoi exceptionnel."

In this picture, the gigantic tail fins of the A380--which together are about the same size as the wings of an Airbus A320--pass through the center of Levignac.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a79f58a7-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/56b8adc511bb32793cc81c8ea473a681/Tail_fins_going_away.jpg
The gigantic A380 tail fans are seen having just passed through the center of Levignac.

The end of the middle section of the fuselage is covered, and text on the cover makes sure no one forgets exactly what's under wraps.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a77f61a3-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2e18a494b1558e24f788f71b461a9a9f/Fuselage_middle_section.jpg

With the windows of some of the village's houses just next to it, the rear section of the fuselage brings up the end of the convoy.

http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a7591988-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6f802478786b1a80cc4d76f689ac5c76/Convoy_going_away.jpg
After the convoy has finished passing through town, the party spills out into the middle of the street.

http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a74f1da2-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2b4ddc7b34572413bd1c83a4a29a254c/Nose_section_from_front.jpg
The morning after the convoy passes through Levignac, all the A380 components are seen together outside the A380 final assembly facility in Blagnac, France, just outside Toulouse.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a7467086-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b1398add8834a1977a5d7d7611bd5cbc/Wing.jpg
In this photograph, we see the wings that were part of the convoy resting outside the A380 final assembly plant in Blagnac, France.

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/17/a739215c-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c3ad494e24a94767c3047e96379b78c9/Fuselage_in_three_sections.jpg
When they passed through Levignac, the three fuselage sections were on individual trucks, one after the other. But outside the assembly plant, they're placed side by side. Soon, they'll be brought inside the plant and Airbus will make another A380.




 
 
 
[Date]2011-07-19  tallest bridge
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/15/a39ef668-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/9faf467acfa1e67234549b84e613d938/Just_in_front_all_towers.jpg
When faced with a problem--a significant missing link on one of the major north-south highways out of Paris--the French came up with the perfect solution: build the tallest bridge in the world. Called the Millau Viaduct, because it spans the Tarn River just outside this small French town not too far from Clermont-Ferrand, this massive bridge towers 1,125 feet above the Tarn Valley--and by the way, cuts 37.3 miles off the drive from Paris to Perpignan in the south.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/15/a3990bb9-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b3d1ddc1df891fa5eec5a3fc5a50aa5a/Just_in_front_tall_towers.jpg
For years before the Millau Viaduct opened for traffic in late 2004, teams were working on the idea of completing the missing link on the A75 autoroute that connects Paris in the north to Perpignan in the south. The first sketches were made in 1987, with each proposing a bridge that spanned the Tarn Valley, though some had the crossing east of Millau, while others had it to the west.
In 1994, the decision was made to locate the bridge just a few kilometers west of Millau. And in 1996, the bridge design by Michel Virlogeux of Ponts et Chaussees and architecture by Norman Foster was selected. According to the official Millau Viaduct Web site, "A multi-stay cabled construction will be seen on the Aveyron skyline. Its aesthetic aspect and integration into the countryside attracted the government departments. It took preference over four other potential projects: a bridge of constant thickness, a variable thickness bridge, a viaduct with stays stretched under the deck, and a construction with one single arch."
In December 2001, the first stone for the Millau Viaduct was laid.
In this photograph, the bridge is seen from just in front and to the east.

In this archival photograph, the Millau Viaduct is seen under construction. It opened to traffic in late 2004.
According to the bridge's official Web site, it is 8,071 feet long, 105 feet wide, 1,125 feet tall (which makes it 62 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower), and cost about $562 million to build. It has seven towers, and 154 stays--11 pairs per tower pylon.

This is the first BMW model of car, a 3/15 PS, made from 1929 to 1932. "Although basically a British Austin Seven built under license," a sign at the museum reads, "BMW's engineers were able to incorporate many improvements such as four-wheel brakes, a larger all-steal body, and a higher standard of interior equipment and trim."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/25/6eb84232-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/921e1fad30a65fd964f27b4cf998fb23/Spiral_stairs.jpg
Reminiscent of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the BMW Museum's central feature is a bowl that brings visitors into a "system of seemingly hovering platforms,"
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6eb0779d-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4446a0dcbcb8ff8483a8217722014fc1/First_BMW_car_3-15_PS_-_Van.jpg
In addition to being offered as a standard car, the BMW 3/15 PS was also offered starting in 1930 as a small van that had two seats and a loading space in the back. Though it topped out at 47 miles an hour, this version of the van was sold as an "express delivery vehicle."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6eab30dc-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/691edd316ea948323b764efaf489c72d/1936_328.jpg
This 1936 BMW 328 roadster, is "among the legends of automobile history," claims the BMW Museum. "The sum of its qualities made it almost unbeatable in the two-liter motor racing category. Only 403 cars were built to standard road-going specification, and are now among the most exclusive and historically significant classics."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6ea53a6e-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac47aeca31040b797a677db307ecad15/1939_328_Mille_Miglia_roadster.jpg
This is the 1939 BMW 328 Mille Miglia Roadster, a car that the company sees as a "unique source of inspirations for BMW Design" even today thanks to "an emotive formal idiom that united aesthetic and functional aspects."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e9d6497-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/96589f2a916c17d2bd6f9a1625f11172/1939_BMW_328.jpg
This is a 1939 BMW 328.

This a 1934 BMW 315/1, the company's first 6-cylinder roadster. The two-seater was designed to be lightweight, yet have a high power output.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/25/6e8a42a6-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/127608323df86a9e1c313dfc994a88ea/BMW_Museum.jpg
On the right is the BMW Museum, with its entry building in the foreground. On the left is the BMW headquarters office highrise.

This is a 1939 BMW 355, the car maker's first luxury "saloon." "The BMW sales department named it the 'Autobahn' model because of its suitability for Germany's new high-speed roads," a museum sign reads. "The powerful 6-cylinder engine and the lightweight body and running gear made it the fastest car in its class. For well-off customers, a two- or four-door convertible was available as an alternative to the saloon."
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e7f8ef3-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fa408bcc3243c67613dcca5a5f53c39e/1956_507.jpg
This is the 1956 BMW 507. According to the BMW Museum, this car "is regarded as one of the most beautiful sports cars of all timeÖ.Almost all the BMW 507s ever built have survived in museums and car collections."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e7b3ce2-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/92341d4421cca14371b2fd8f5c9e3f31/First_BMW_roadster.jpg
This is the 1930 BMW 3/15 PS DA 3 Typ Wartburg, the company's first roadster. It was made under license from Austin. "The small two-seater weighed only [904 pounds], so that despite its low power output, it scored many a success in motor sport."
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e74efb2-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a4f70a57b5682d86118beb7e46c505e6/1955_Isetta.jpg
This is the 1955 BMW Isetta, "Motocoupe," which was originally created by Italy's Ise. The car "helped BMW to overcome through a difficult commercial phase and avoid dismissing members of its workforce," according to the museum. "Various versions of this successful 'bubble car' were built, amounting to more than 160,000 by the time production ceased in 1962."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e6f68e4-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/19859691df1ae476d8fcee6b28e1cf52/1968_BMW_3.jpg
This is the top model in the BMW 2500 and 2800 line, the 1968 3.3 Li, the immediate predecessors to the company's long-successful 7-Series.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e653a99-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ba2ebc582b22495a23187d14e434c02f/1966_2002ti.jpg
This is the 1966 BMW 2002 ti. According to the museum, "BMW introduced a new midsize model in 1966: the BMW 1600-2. It marked the beginning of an exceptional success story. Over the next ten years, more cars from what was later known as the 02 Series were sold than the complete output of BMW cars since 1929. The combination of modern, compact bodies, sports engines, and running gear and suitability for more modest family motoring provoked world wide interest....The most notable cars in this model line were those bearing the 2002 badge [whose] engines developed between 100 and 170 horsepower and gave these lightweight saloons, convertibles, and touring models their remarkable dynamism."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e5c1337-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5dd16779eaef92ce4998d5125e3b016e/M1.jpg
This is the world-famous BMW M1.

This is a 1923 BMW R 32 motorcycle. Its transverse flat-twin engine and shaft drive came to be characteristic features of the company's motorcycles, according to the museum.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/24/6e460552-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/bb32ce6237b3096c0345553aef6ccc53/1999_Z9_GT.jpg
This is the 1999 BMW Z9 GT which "ushered in a new design era for BMW's large saloon and coupe models," according to the museum. "Its combination of presence, dynamism, and sculptured styling reformulated classic BMW design elements, and its engineering innovations both inside and out exerted an influence throughout the automobile industry."

Here, in the Porsche Exclusive workshop in Stuttgart, a highly trained employee labors to help a customer get just what he or she wants out of his or her new car.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/28/4bd969f4-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8d8f2c545abb5c0776827f6ab983c202/Red_with_black_hood.jpg

This is the same red 911 GT with a black spoiler.
In most cases, Porsche will do whatever customization a customer asks for. An American ostrich farmer, for example, got his new Porsche with his own ostrich leather used in the interior. And an Arabian king ordered cars in the country's national colors for all his ministers.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/28/4bcabbc8-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c47b514e7f615993c37d9d4e534f5291/Last_Speedsters.jpg
Porsche made just 356 of one of the hottest models to come off its production lines in years: the Speedster. Each Speedster is considered special enough that it is outfitted in the Exclusive workshop, and all options buyers had were considered special, though they were included in the car's price. These are the last two Speedsters Porsche produced.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/07/28/4bc41644-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a9581b4d1fcf1e6c76d0713df89925b6/Interior_with_red_trim.jpg
This is an example of a custom red trim ordered by a Porsche customer.
The company does its best to satisfy buyers' requests, but sometimes it has to say no. For example, one buyer asked for a different spoiler for his car's front than is included in the aerodynamic kit that also includes a rear spoiler. Porsche had to say no because the change would have affected the car's aerodynamics. Another customer asked for a different sound from the tail pipe, and Porsche said that while it would be happy to do the job, the law wouldn't allow the modification.

In the Porsche Exclusive showroom, the company showcases many of the different kinds of customization it will do for customers. For example, this yellow exterior--with matching trim in the interior--is not standard.

For 25 years, Porsche has offered customers willing to pay a bit more for their cars a wide range of special customization choices. Some choose to have a plate with the Porsche Exclusive logo added to their car.

Few would likely choose this all-brown color scheme, but if someone wanted it, Porsche would produce it. For a fee.

This is the Zeppelin NT flown by Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei, a ZLT subsidiary.

Seen here in front of the Zeppelin NT hangar in Friedrichshafen, Germany, is the Audi A6 TFSI that CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman drove through Switzerland and Germany on Road Trip 2011.

On a stormy day, ZLT's Zeppelin NT cannot take passengers aloft, so it sits inside the company's hangar in Friedrichshafen, Germany, moored to its truck-based mast.

http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/08/02/2229b450-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac9916c5f62bb430e3aa0471c0a532a2/Rear_of_zeppelin_with_propellers.jpg
This is the rear rotor of the Zeppelin NT. Because of its internal airframe and flexible rotors, it is able to take off much like a helicopter, unlike a blimp, which has much less maneuverability. Rotors on the side of the Zeppelin can rotate up to 120 degrees, while the rear rotor can rotate 90 degrees. According to ZLT, "The capabilities of a vertical take-off, a precise landing, hovering on one spot and a backward flight are the unique flight characteristics enabled by the swivelling propellers."

http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2011/08/02/22222602-f0f3-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/aa67e86baf2435cc6247340312e57ccf/Zeppelin_truck.jpg

Seen here, against the wall of the giant Zeppelin NT hangar, are struts and internal parts for a new Zeppelin that is being constructed inside the hangar. The parts are actually from a decommissioned Japanese Zeppelin and the new airship is scheduled to fly in April of 2012.

Just a few doors down from the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio is this stunner, the Walter H. Gale house, which is one of a group of houses that he designed when he was still employed by Louis Sullivan. Because he was not allowed to moonlight, these houses are known as "bootlegs." Wright designed it in 1893.

[Date]2013-07-03  In Chicago, the birthplace of the nuclear age

This is an artist's drawing of Chicago Pile-1, which was created in about a month. It was a pile, 24 feet wide by 24 feet long, and 19 feet high, of machined uranium and graphite blocks.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/02/0ea46b0d-f07b-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6822ada803d9e37a6154891a8b5c7b3d/Scale_model_showing_squash_court.jpg
This scale model, housed in the Nuclear Energy Exhibit at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill., shows how the Chicago Pile-1 project was constructed inside the squash court under the bleachers at the University of Chicago's football field.
According to a  document (PDF)  hosted on the U.S. Department of Energy's Web site, that location was chosen in a hurry after the first choice, the Argonne Woods, was abandoned due to "slow construction." As a result, "the largest space available" was selected.

This view of the scale model in the Nuclear Energy Exhibit at Argonne National Lab shows where the people who viewed the experiment watched from.
In addition, it also shows (if you look closely) that a man was stationed against the railing holding on to a rope that pulled a control rod. In an emergency, that rope was supposed to be cut, which would slide the rod into the core, absorbing neutrons and stopping the chain reaction.
As a backup safety measure, buckets of cadmium in liquid were ready to be poured over the pile, which would leak into it and shut down the reaction, according to Roger Blomquist, a nuclear engineer at Argonne National Lab.

Chicago Pile-1 was dismantled almost as fast as it was constructed, and it was quickly re-assembled in the Argonne Woods near today's Argonne National Lab. Today, all that remains of one of history's most important technological events is this memorial, found in the middle of the University of Chicago.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/02/0e978c7a-f07b-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/644c74eef7d84f5dafde92d0bf15fe0c/Plaque_2.jpg
A plaque near the memorial at the University of Chicago reads, "On December 2, 1942, man achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy."
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/02/0e94be8a-f07b-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e9aacad8a1f010b52a9cd6eac3531e0b/Fermi.jpg
Enrico Fermi won the Nobel Prize in 1938. As the leader of the Pile-1 project, he was the man most responsible for demonstrating that man could tame nuclear energy. According to Argonne National Lab's Blomquist, nobody has ever combined a mastery of physics and mathematics at such a high level as Fermi.

After the successful completion of the Chicago Pile-1 experiment -- which Fermi concluded after about 28 minutes of a self-sustaining chain reaction -- each of the 49 people on hand were given a small amount of chianti from this bottle, seen in a photograph at the Argonne National Lab.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/02/0e8d3413-f07b-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5df88152de69cc8186f87aae74165611/Signatures.jpg

The pile, which was built on top of a wooden frame on the squash court under the Stagg Field bleachers, consisted of "alternate layers of graphite, containing uranium metal and/or oxide," according to the document on the Department of Energy's Web site, which "were separated by layers of solid graphite blocks to form a lattice structure."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/02/0e880a9c-f07b-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1b75478909c48c38cbfe35471b14dd06/Were_cooking.jpg
This record shows the progress of the Chicago Pile-1 experiment, and at the bottom left of the right-hand page, "We're cookin!" was written to signify that the experiment was successful. That phrase was used, according to a placard at the Argonne National Lab's Nuclear Energy Exhibit, because "a nuclear reaction has been likened to the burning of a pile of oily rags that in certain circumstances can ignite spontaneously."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/02/0e8577b9-f07b-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f452be6096e2aa82269463c50602951a/Photo_of_Stagg_Field_West_Stands.jpg
This photograph, on the wall of the Argonne National Lab's Nuclear Energy Exhibit, shows the University of Chicago's Stagg Field bleachers, inside of which the Chicago Pile-1 experiment was conducted in secret.

This photograph, hosted by the Argonne National Lab, depicts Chicago Pile-2 in 1943. The so-called CP-2 was created "when Chicago Pile 1, the world's first nuclear reactor, was dismantled and moved to the Cook County Forest Preserve near Palos Hills, Ill.. At the new, isolated location, the reactor was reassembled with some refinements and modifications and renamed Chicago Pile 2. CP-2 had a thermal-power level of 10 kW and was fueled by natural uranium. A small laboratory atop the 14,000-ton reactor provided space for limited experiments using neutrons from the reactor's core. The reactor's face contained ports through which materials could be inserted into the core for irradiation."

Originally selected as the home for the world's first nuclear reactor and the first-ever sustained chain reaction, Site A, in the Argonne Woods, was host to a re-creation of Chicago Pile-1 immediately after the successful experiment conducted at the University of Chicago. CP-1 was dismantled and reassembled at Site A.

This is a look inside one of the Spectra T-Finity cabinets that make up the 380 petabytes of long term storage.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff3c2fc3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/84fec6f74901d0f5bb202b7175e91665/Blue_Waters_whole_system.jpg
The National Petascale Computing Facility was built with 20,000 of usable space for Blue Waters. The facility was built with biometric scanners for security -- so that it can compete for future applications with high-security operations elsewhere -- and can withstand an F3 tornado.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff34fb73-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5f448e2234a8f1d1e9bd0da64b394114/cables_above.jpg
It takes a huge amount of cables to power and connect all the Blue Waters nodes, as this look at the wiring infrastructure underneath the supercomputer reveals.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff32ad11-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/db9da06244e554bbfc417f55f81b3db7/Blue_Waters_rear_open_close-up.jpg
Blue Waters consists of 12 rows of 24 Cray cabinets, including this one, seen from the back with its wiring on display.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff3071e9-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4cfb08a0c50d7a0c268d21249a417f8b/Blue_Waters_blades.jpg
Each of the Blue Waters cabinets has 24 blades arrayed in three rows of eight blades each.

Cray has a number of employees on-site at the National Petascale Computing Facility in order to service and maintain Blue Waters.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff2a1eaa-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3c90f0e1ca1914fe59265b09f2d81aa3/Tape_storage_1.jpg
For long-term storage needs, the National Petascale Computing Facility provides Blue Waters users with 380 petabytes of tape storage.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff274b9d-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d608cb381436631ffee3e2e87a50b74b/Blue_Waters_cooling_piping_silver.jpg
Each of Blue Waters' rows has three cooling cabinets at the end, which are connected to the computing nodes via the silver piping on the top.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff24cc3d-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b36891f656baea83e86c833c6ff84ff9/Cray_Sonexion_Cabinets_-_closeup.jpg
 
In addition to the 380 petabytes of long-term tape storage available to Blue Waters users, there is also 26 petabytes of short-term, online storage available via these Cray Sonexion machines.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff225ba4-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/bb10a1d5b4ca436e0ee598984825678f/Cabling_under_floor.jpg
Opening up the floor in the Blue Waters room reveals massive amounts of cables and wires that connect the various nodes.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff2009cf-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/826d078bb099c1d83a8202e42ec91495/Pump_room_1.jpg
In order to operate Blue Waters, the National Petascale Computing Facility maintains these massive cooling pipes, which altogether circulate 5,400 tons of chilled water with a capacity of 9,300 gallons per minute.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff1da5d8-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/63d5754fdd821617d7fb172b7454e4ae/Pump_room_with_heat_exchangers.jpg
Water is pumped through giant sumps and then to heat exchangers (on the left side, on the floor) in order to provide Blue Waters with enough cooling water.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff1b5e03-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8bf4b026af8959cdf4f2cd24349a6414/Transformer.jpg
In order to provide Blue Waters with enough power to stay operational 24 hours a day, the National Petascale Computing Facility has 20 transformers -- of which 14 are dedicated to the supercomputer. The system has a capacity of 13,800 volts coming in, and it is approved for a total of 24 megawatts, although it is currently only using about 13.5 megawatts. That means the facility can almost double in size if needed.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff19028b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/972e69bc34efd71281e1b3b2d8cc2d9a/Electrical_room.jpg
The NPCF has a total of 20 giant transformers, 14 for Blue Waters, two spares, two which serve non-Blue Waters systems, and two which serve the facility itself.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/03/ff16cad2-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2db0f6523be1f91481416530385f7242/Sump.jpg

The Bean is entirely reflective, and distorts what it reflects, so the incredible skies of a perfect July 4th are stunning when seen alongside Kapoor's masterpiece.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/04/ff5ffd98-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dc5b945a15ba64bc9474f89b07bc3e97/IMG_5823.jpg
Located in the heart of ATT Plaza in Chicago's terrific Millennium Park, The Bean is easy to see, and has something for everyone.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/04/ff5d8f33-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ea0d64b488dceb96dcd35950dc28f4fb/IMG_5808.jpg

[Date]2013-07-08   Robie House, Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece, regains glory
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe835f6f-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c0f2e77b6d318bd15226de7e442f09a2/Robie_Hosue.jpg
With what is the quintessential example of Wright's Prairie Style of architecture, Robie House is a stunning work of art. Located at the University of Chicago, the house, completed in 1910 for businessman Frederick C. Robie, is in the middle of a major, multi-million-dollar renovation that should return it to its original glory.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe80cd32-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/55dd94577bfa1a9673aac30c6f748d05/Robie_House_looking_east.jpg
Robie House features Wright's signature geometric design, with long horizontal lines and striking angles at every turn. The house was a true collaboration between Wright and Robie, although the new owner only lived there for about 18 months before being forced to sell the building to help pay off his late father's debts.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe7e59e0-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7ad72c55f089e197aba66caecb508fa1/Robie_SW_corner_view.jpg
Robie purchased the lot for the house in 1908 for $13,500, when his family was still wealthy, and the house was finished in 1910.
The southwest corner of the house looks to many like a boat, and a lot of people refer to that corner as "the prow."

Wright used Roman brick throughout Robie House because of their long rectangular, horizontal, shape, and the fact that he could use vertical mortar between the bricks that matched the color of the bricks, maintaining the sense that the facade was all horizontal lines.
Everything about the house instills the sense of horizontal conveyed by the flat landscape of the American prairie, which surrounded the house when it was built, and with which Wright was very familiar.

Wright enjoyed creating interesting entrances to his buildings and giving owners a sense of privacy outside their front doors. While it's not hard to find Robie House's front door, it is partially hidden away behind an outer gate.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe76d735-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/08bf9b062869b980efab953bed661ffe/Courtyard.jpg
Given that Robie House was built just a few years after mass production of cars began, it's quite possible -- although no one knows for sure -- that its attached three-car garage may be the world's first. The garage was purpose-built for cars rather than converted from storing horse-drawn carriages.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe732dfa-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2ac99041e924eb1fa30710a9bae655dc/Front_door.jpg
Robie House also features a wider-than-normal front door. Wright designed the building in order, like with many of his buildings, to bring the outside in, but maintain the privacy of those inside.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe70d2f6-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/662ae98d4394baa2ed212088b9c12e6e/Entrance_way.jpg
This is Robie House's entrance room. It features lots of natural colors, and a large carpet that George Mann Niedecken, who worked for Wright, designed.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe6e71cb-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1ccf492034fa1abb38b4a2149c451bb9/Entrance_way_hearth.jpg
Like so many of Wright's buildings, Robie House provides its residents with grand hearths. This one is in the house's entrance room.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe6c049b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d03b411f0dcae1546fd5e7aee2a162da/Stairway_up.jpg
Wright enjoyed paths of discovery, and those could be stairways as well as hallways. This is the main Robie House stairway that leads up from the entrance room to the living room on the second level.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe698c22-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/66d3be8df9cbb42d2d98b37c3d19584b/Looking_out_over_interior_staircase.jpg

Those who climbed the Robie House staircase for the first time couldn't possibly have been prepared for just how grand the living room -- which they would encounter when they got to the top of the stairs -- was.
Designed with one of Wright's specialties -- the open floor plan -- the living room was a giant room featuring recessed lighting with what appears to be a Japanese influence, a common trait in Wright's houses.

A veranda on the west side of the house allows those inside to step outside where they have a lovely view of the surroundings, and a veiw back at the house, protected from the weather by the building's grand cantilevered roof.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe5f415b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/179b7a2863da44d417bc4d4c161d6b1e/Balcony_and_cantilevered_roof.jpg
The balcony offers a look at University of Chicago buildings across the street, as well as protection from one of Wright's signature touches, a large, cantilevered roof.

Today, after having gone through many different owners -- including several institutions -- Robie House is owned by the University of Chicago and managed by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust, which got a $5.5 million grant to do the renovation.
Twice, in 1941 and again in 1957, Robie House was slated for demolition, and both times Wright stepped in personally to save his masterpiece. Wright argued in 1957 that, "Why destroy this building any more than you would destroy an important painting? Because it's more important than any could possibly be."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe557921-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/05c75341b4f0495acec1af8c5326013c/Living_room_art_glass.jpg
Like so many of Wright's buildings, Robie House features windows with what's known as "art glass." The house has 175 art glass windows.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe530d5b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5f10d48b7df581f9d8605b416040be37/Living_room_art_glass_tall.jpg
These doors open onto the south-side balcony from the living room and feature Wright's famous art glass design.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe50ae88-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1992ff44213b9c8810b70ff56a6acb39/Art_glass_south_side.jpg
Wright brought the outside in through the use of dozens of windows throughout, but maintained the privacy of those inside, in part by using art glass instead of clear windows.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe4e4840-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d460fd553f4b4a170b13e5c9533c62cf/FLW_cornice.jpg
Another Wright signature was the use of cornices -- essentially rain gutters -- on the underneath edges of the roof.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe4bf42e-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/24a1286a77b743954e2fa9843cb1e6a6/Sconce.jpg
Robie House still has one original sconce, a light that casts beautiful shadows and indirect lighting, a favorite design element of Wright's.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe498cd0-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b70e0be8054df33ea94fca82bf805d82/Living_room_long_looking_east.jpg

The living room features another hearth, which in keeping with one of Wright's favorite design elements, has open space directly above the fireplace, and two flues on both sides.

As he often did, Wright designed built-in furniture into the Robie House dining room. Doing this allowed him to maintain more control over the interior living space than many architects enjoy.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe3f9e7c-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2c82f5a0efd6a4c8febfbd43500b72b1/Breakfast_nook.jpg
Wright liked designing rooms within rooms in his buildings, and Robie House is no different. This is a breakfast nook found at the east side of the house's open dining room.

The master bedroom had a grand master closet that included built-in drawers, meaning that residents didn't have to have bulky chests of drawers.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/06/fe360fea-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d9973b085fb555a257ccc510c7b05914/Master_closet.jpg
The closet doors in the master bedroom were faithful to Wright's love of geometric patterns.

Some of the house's art glass is seen leaning against the wall in one of the upstairs bedroom. The glass is being repaired as part of the major renovation project.
 
[Date]2013-07-09  How the Wright brothers won the race to invent the airplane
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f6459452-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4982c1f72e1f0529151d432fc01dbce0/Wright_Flyer_610x405.jpg
The original Wright Flyer, with which the Wright brothers made the world's first airplane flight on December 17, 1903, is permanently housed at the Smithsonian's Air  Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park has a replica of the aircraft
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f64304b3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0d47b021b5b704fe7f649aaf4b6d2a1c/Wright_Flyer_III.jpg
Although the original Wright Flyer gets most of the ink -- and why not, given that it made the first-ever manned, powered flight, which was captured in a perfect photograph -- some would say that the brothers' Wright Flyer III, which they used to perfect their airplane design, is more important in the annals of aviation.
Today, the plane, which on October 5, 1905, made a 24-mile, 39-minute flight -- more than all other flights made by anyone up to that time combined -- is permanently housed in the Wright brothers exhibit at the Carillon Historical Park Museum.
The main reason this plane may be more important to aviation history is that, because the Wrights used it to demonstrate that they'd solved most of the technical problems they'd been working on for years, they were now able to market the machine. And that meant, primarily, that they could seek out a contract with the U.S. Army. This formed the basis of the Wright Company, their airplane business, which made them rich, unlike their previous printing and bicycle businesses.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f6406275-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/b9d9c9548e7613d2c6d0290864ef6c6b/Wright_Flyer_III_pilot.jpg
As with the Wright Flyer I, the pilot of the Wright Flyer III lay down horizontally at the front of the aircraft and flew alone. But before it would sign a deal with the brothers, the U.S. Army insisted that the airplane be able to take a passenger, and that both pilot and passenger sit upright.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f63db3ab-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/e20b391ecdb444d161b5df946b43538f/Military_Flyer_diagram.jpg
Based on the Army's requirements, this was the Wrights' new design for their airplane, the Wright Military Flyer.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f63aff15-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/691752a53e047239af2fa6d0021413d2/First_flight_camera.jpg
To some, this camera may be one of the most iconic in history, given that it was used to photograph the Wrights' first flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C. The Wrights turned to local photographer John T. Daniels to document the flight. Daniels was fortunate to click the shutter with the Wright Flyer in the center of the frame, and with Wilbur Wright running alongside as his brother Orville flew for 120 feet at an airspeed of about 34 miles an hour.
The Wrights had set the camera up to point at the spot at which the plane would go aloft. It was in focus, and all Daniels had to do was click the shutter. But in the excitement of the moment, Daniels couldn't remember if he'd managed to do his job. Fortunately for history, he did.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f6384e01-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ac4ce9315c308a230d22398958e93bf3/1911_test_engine.jpg
This is a 35-horsepower test engine built for the Wrights in 1911 by their mechanic, Charles Taylor, who had built the 170-pound, 12-horsepower gas engine that the Wrights used to power the Wright Flyer I for the December 17, 1903, first flight.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f634f3b8-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/df69302ce1756631a54fd8426ed5f4a5/Wind_tunnel.jpg
Another one of the Wrights' innovations in 1901 was using a wind tunnel to figure out the effectiveness of wind foils of a number of shapes. They used the wind tunnel to confirm results they had made earlier including one testing a rotating airfoil they mounted on one of their own bicycles.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f6321071-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d7c931463bd87d9f9af7861fa540a9b4/Wind_tunnel_rudder.jpg
As part of their experiments, a wind foil like this one would be placed inside the wind tunnel and the Wrights would record the results.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f62f6ba3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/34c29382b4a77a98d2ff950579387504/Bicycle_airfoil.jpg
Before using the wind tunnel, the Wrights had come up with an ingenious way to test various airfoils by mounting them on the handlebars of one of their bicycles and recording the results as they rode the bike.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f62ccc96-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d0eb61cdfa9fa21b14605218f4ea7a8f/Huffman_catalpult.jpg
Although the Wrights made their first flight in secrecy at Kitty Hawk, N.C., as they progressed in perfecting the airplane, they needed to be able to do much more frequent testing back home in Dayton as well.
As a result, they chose a cow pasture in a flood plain on the edge of town now known as the Huffman Prairie Flying Field.
There, the Wrights conducted countless tests of their various planes, and even set up a flying school there. It was here that the Wrights conducted their 39-minute flight that convinced them they were ready to patent their work and get their airplane business of the ground.
Although the Wrights had long experience with bicycles, they somehow hadn't originally come up with the idea of putting wheels on their planes. That meant that in order to get the planes in the air, they needed to catapult them. This is a replica of the catapult they installed at Huffman Prairie. The plane would be thrust down the rail and it would vault into the air when it hit the right speed.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f62a22b3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/11f7465293bd61a8e76d277d225026fb/Huffman_hangar.jpg
This is a replica of the hangar the Wrights used to store their equipment at Huffman Prairie Flying Field.

While there were numerous challenges to their patent for what they called their "flying machine," the Wrights maintained their rights in large part because their patent attorney, Harry Toulmin, wrote a very broad application that included the concept of three-axis flying. Though the patent was granted, there were many who didn't accept the Wrights' claim to having invented the airplane, and even the Smithsonian Institute, which has been a big supporter of the Wright brothers story, didn't acknowledge their claim until 1942.
This is a replica of their original patent.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f6249b36-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/634d18e6ff5334a5992ebca11010a5c8/Wright_Cycle_sign.jpg
Before inventing the airplane, the Wright brothers had run two other businesses, one a print shop, and the other a bicycle-making company.
They sold two types of bikes, the Van Cleve, and the St. Claire.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f621e93b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/cd84504705460414ca298abd01fb58de/Wright_Cycle.jpg
There are very few original Wright brothers bicycles left in existence. But the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park has one, this St. Claire.
The Wrights were likely able to take years to perfect their airplane design not because of the success of their bicycle business, but because their father had money and the brothers lived at home, meaning their costs were far lower than would have otherwise been the case.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/08/f61f1cde-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f12fe6aa481097744b2acd9eb74f6025/Model_gliders.jpg
On display at the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park are these three models of the Wrights' early gliders.
The one of the bottom is a model of the Wrights' 1900 glider, which had a wing span of 17 feet. They made their first flight using this aircraft, which was made from wood and cotton sateen fabric. The glider did prove that their basic design was air-worthy, but they had difficulty getting it aloft with the weight of a pilot in normal winds. The glider weighed 190 pounds.
The middle aircraft is their 1901 glider, which had a wing span of 22 feet and weighed 98 pounds. They built this hoping that they had solved the lift problems with a forward elevator meant to control pitch. However, it was still difficult to control, despite the fact that the Wrights used this glider to break a number of distance records.
The 1902 glider, on top, had a wing span of 32 feet, 1 inch, and weighed 112 pounds. They installed a movable single rudder to handle yaw problems, and the glider became the first aircraft to be totally under the pilot's command, according to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park. They made more than 250 glides with the aircraft, some nearly 600 feet.

This is a broken piece of the mounting foot from the Wright Flyer I. On December 17, 1903, they made the first-ever airplane flight at Kitty Hawk, and over the course of the day, they made three more flights, the longest traveling 852 feet. A gust of wind subsequently flipped the plane, heavily damaging it.

With the riches they earned from their airplane company, the Wrights purchased this mansion atop a hill just outside Dayton.
 
 
 
 
[Date]2013-07-10  Building the U.S. Army's M1A2 Abrams tank
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f31a1243-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/d5f8a9ac8e4d2b05afcb71ad9815d3cb/Tanks_on_railcars_1.jpg
In 1996, the plant stopped making brand-new hulls and turrets for the U.S. Army's Abrams tanks, instead choosing to recondition older M1A2 systems that were still in working order.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f317794b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/966fc2d1b933d0c7a402a712c8b5dc1f/Rustys_on_rails_2.jpg
Before the production of a reconditioned M1A2 Abrams tank can begin, the plant first receives rail cars full of decommissioned tanks, known as a "rusty."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f313090f-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1ba823340f686bf2d63938d4e95928a4/Rusty_and_shot-blasted_hulls_1.jpg
After the plant receives the "rusties," workers take the old hulls and turrets and put them through a shot-blasting process, stripping them of years of rust. On the left is a rusty, and on the right is a hull that has been shot-blasted.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f31030d2-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/af54e4048a7748a5e63024ec8c888306/Rusty_hull_1.jpg
A look at the interior of the hull of a "rusty" that was first built in the early 1990s.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f30d5ed0-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/273e38013eaf142cef0bb89f22fd0335/De-masked_hull_1.jpg
After the hulls and turrets have been shot-blasted and painted, they then go through the process of being de-masked. This hull has already gone through that step,  meaning it is now ready for the assembly line.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f30a7885-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/6272dca9cb54b2f8edef5f157f91d0e0/Cannon_assembly_1.jpg
Once the turrets have been shot-blasted and de-masked, they have a set of so-called ammo doors added to them. After that, the cannons are mounted on them. But first, workers test the cannon recoil to ensure that the shock of firing it is properly absorbed inside the turret.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f3077afb-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ff3f7d72cda01c484845cfd58aa2e735/Completed_turret_lifted_up_1.jpg
After the cannon is installed on the turret, the turrets are moved to the assembly line for the addition of interior equipment and systems. CNET was not able to see this part of the assembly process due to its sensitive nature.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2fdc3b1-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4e8faa0ad44fec7c18086aecab3d73ed/Abrams_Turret.jpg
This is a completed turret coming off the assembly line. It will be set aside until later in the process, when it will be married with a completed hull.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2faf5ed-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a63ede998ec3a4d87f03c16c67b786be/The_basket_1.jpg
This is what's known as "the basket." Essentially, it is the pod inside of which three of the tank's crew members -- the gunner, the commander, and the loader, as well as 2,000 pounds of electronics and gear -- will sit. The basket is loaded up from underneath the turret and installed.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2f82e81-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/75d353f0c77ca1ab096a2d00ca3e655f/Station_3_1.jpg
This is Station 3, where an Abrams hull that has had many of its internal equipment and systems installed, is lifted off the ground in order to have its suspension components installed.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2f55ff1-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/f9a4ee229d2a0bfb6d1fbf4bf97c3805/Road_wheels_1.jpg
These are what are known as "road wheels," which are mounted on the Abrams before the tank's track is installed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2f296b4-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1afadf8b89386a98534b82cef894aaa5/Hull_assembly_line_1.jpg
This is the Abrams hull assembly line. Workers systematically install equipment at a series of stations along the line. A drag line pulls the hulls forward, since they don't have their suspension installed at this point.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2eebbc6-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/57c4018bde341e2f61232a537019dd27/Ammo_rack_1.jpg
Most of the tank's ammunition is stored in the turret, but some is kept in the hull, in ammunition racks like this one.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2ec1261-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3250d5e4e9b9b30f27335507d819bb7b/Fuel_cell_1.jpg
This is one of the Abrams tank's fuel cells, or gas tanks. The Abrams is not particularly fuel-efficient, getting 1.9 gallons to the mile.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2e95bc8-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/1ee687f7d82a4be79861eed1d17246a9/Slip_ring_1.jpg
Installed at the interior base of the hull, this is the slip ring, a cylinder that allows the tank's turret to turn 360 degrees without its wires ending up tangled.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2e6d0a5-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/262fd34960c8fb6684f6ff9703406c5c/Fire_suppression_system_1.jpg
This is the tank's fire suppression system. If a fire breaks out inside, it is designed to automatically pour fire-resistant chemicals into the affected areas.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2e4027c-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/7d57eec7c78a7577ef967eb66a5377e0/Hulls_lined_up_1.jpg
A group of Abrams hulls are lined up as they move through the assembly process. At this point, they have their suspension system installed.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2e1536c-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4a54b59ca130bba09097304a5b0da50c/Resting_on_its_own_wheels_1.jpg
Early in the assembly process, the hulls rest on the ground as they don't have their suspension installed. But at this point, they have had their wheels mounted and can now rest on those wheels.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2de954b-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/008db01f33bec3ff5c70b73fa981571f/Systems_inside_hull_1.jpg
Midway down the assembly line, a look at some of the equipment and systems inside the hull's interior.

Part of the tank's suspension system, these are known as final drives. Essentially, these are gears that transfer power from the transmission to the tank's track.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2d943ff-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/48cee784055f359c01d1bc95d06ed6d5/Sprocket_bolted_on_1.jpg
A large sprocket is bolted onto the final drives, and this is what moves the tank's track.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2d65f0a-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2f4c917b7b2fe93b56d5d3285c87476d/FUPP_1.jpg
This is the tank's full-up power pack, or FUPP. It includes the Abrams' engine, transmission, and all cooling apparatus -- the oil coolers and the exhaust. The turbine engine has 1,500 horsepower, and is multi-fuel, meaning that it can work on many different kinds of fuel, from diesel to jet fuel to gasoline to kerosene, and even peanut oil. That gives the tank a great deal of flexibility, which is a major advantage during combat or other activity. 
The FUPP is designed to be "plug and play," meaning that if it is damaged or dysfunctional, it is pulled out in its entirety and replaced with a new one.
On the battlefield, this is thought to be a more efficient way of repairing systems. In a case like this, the defective FUPP will usually be taken away to a maintenance area. In combat zones, replacement FUPPs are carried around by heavy trucks, or possibly delivered by aircraft.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2d39122-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8c820ddf5421604d99a4345d9feb143f/Rolled_up_tracks_1.jpg
Rolls of tank tracks sit on the floor alongside the Abrams assembly line.

In order to install the tank's tracks, they are bolted down at one end, and rolled down on the floor. Then the drag line pulls the tank forward until it sits on top of the track.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2cd2dbf-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c124b47d6425208adcf7c927862e3a61/Track_about_to_be_joined_1.jpg
In order to complete the track installation, a pulley system with winches brings the two ends of the track together, where it is hooked together. Here, we see a track with two ends about to be joined.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/09/f2ca789a-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5963cc5742816db62fe3df597a8f4cbe/Track_joining_by_worker_1.jpg

These are the tank's fire control systems, which are tested after the hull and turret are married.
 
[Date]2013-07-13   Making Goodyear's next-gen blimp
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e6588954-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0d15633bbbe92346eeddb9cd628c3b22/Skin_full_over_front.jpg
A firsthand look at how the new zeppelin is coming together.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e65584f3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/433882164f3512018f0d01ecba86c5b1/Full_width_with_skin.jpg
Goodyear is building the new zeppelin -- which it will still market as a blimp -- inside its Wingfoot Lake airship hangar near Akron, Ohio. The company hopes to formally unveil the new airship later this year, and will begin making the second of three zeppelins in 2015. It should complete construction of the third by 2018. The three zeppelins will replace the blimps that Goodyear currently bases at Akron, Carson, Calif., and Pompano Beach, Fla.
Goodyear purchased the design, and the components for the new zeppelins from Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, which is based in Friedrichshafen, Germany. But Goodyear is building the airships in its Akron hangar, and making several modifications to the standard zeppelin NT design.
Currently, construction of the first new blimp is well under way, with the ship's frame already put together and its skin slowly being stretched out over its full length.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e6528c67-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/260d194e7b80d8cc73ffc42add19d57d/Rear_frame_from_platform_close-up.jpg
A look at the rear end of the frame of the next-generation Goodyear blimp, which is a zeppelin NT designed by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik (ZLT). The new airship is being built jointly by Goodyear and ZLT personnel inside Goodyear's 800-foot-long Wingfoot Lake hangar.
Unlike a traditional blimp, which is essentially just a giant inflated bag, a zeppelin has a rigid frame.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e64f9f90-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3fa5700dab7a693402571235e92f0891/Taking-off_550x367.jpg
Goodyear is replacing its familiar blimps with zeppelins like this one, seen in 2008 and flown by California's now-defunct Airship Ventures. The zeppelins are designed by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik (ZLT), from Friedrichshafen, Germany, and feature three propellers instead of two, and a design that allows the airship to hover like a helicopter. That's one of the primary reasons Goodyear is switching airship platforms, given that being able to hover over a sporting event should allow event TV directors to order specific shots.
Compared with a traditional blimp (see next photo), a zeppelin is longer and has a slightly less oval silhouette.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e64cece3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8b6812d4fe7c69b01dcabfc0cf091857/Blimp.jpg
The Spirit of Goodyear, one of the tire giant's existing three blimps, seen flying near the company's Wingfoot Lake hangar, outside Akron, Ohio. A blimp has a rounder, shorter silhouette than the zeppelins that the company will begin flying later this year.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e64a3cf3-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/73447af466b4d80858a361bdbda40277/Eureka_gondola.jpg
The gondola on a zeppelin -- as seen on Airship Ventures' Eureka -- is larger and more comfortable than that of Goodyear's traditional blimps. In addition to seating 12 people instead of 6, the zeppelin's gondola is also much quieter because the engines are not directly outside. That means passengers can talk normally and don't need to wear headsets to hear each other.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e6477b7d-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3ca8a162d90083fee738128511f98aa2/Blimp_gondola.jpg
The gondola found on Goodyear's traditional blimps is smaller and more cramped, and requires passengers to talk to each other using a headset, because the engines are directly outside.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e6443d4d-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/79d6d6972cce7bda61b20882b5784539/Skin_full_over_front_right_side.jpg
A look at Goodyear's new blimp, which is being built inside its Akron, Ohio hangar. The tire giant is switching from traditional blimps to zeppelins, which are longer, faster, quieter, and can hover over events instead of having to circle around them.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e6412b61-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fc7fe157b5d5f8bf09d8ff4f73bd389c/Straight_on_front.jpg
Though Goodyear's new zeppelins will be the world's largest airships, they're dwarfed by the size of the tire giant's hangar outside Akron, Ohio.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e63e0990-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/8bb8304b1207f024a2dce341d8bd66cc/Rear_frame_from_platform_close-up_underneath.jpg
A look at the underside of the frame of the new Goodyear blimp, which is being built at the tire company's Akron, Ohio, airship hangar in conjunction with personnel from Germany's Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, which designed it.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e63b07e9-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3d1f085d0c6777d70fa88ad1df744db1/Skin_held_aloft.jpg
Because the zeppelin has a rigid frame, it's built by first constructing the frame and then slowly stretching the skin over the top. By comparison, a blimp is made by starting with the skin on the ground and slowly inflating it.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e637ddd6-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c5edb64f76f263c5481030ce7ed290a5/Weights.jpg
These weights are being used to hold down the ropes that are holding up the skin as it is slowly and methodically pulled over the zeppelin's rigid frame.

The zeppelin features these triangular trusses, made from lightweight composite materials, that help maintain its structure.

Though it appears that the yellow frame is the zeppelin's bottom, it is actually only its middle. The fabric seen underneath the frame will be pulled all the way to the airship's far (rear) end, and once fully enclosed, the zeppelin will be inflated using helium, which will raise the frame up well off the floor.

The three fins for the new Goodyear blimp sit on the floor alongside the airship.

The interior of a zeppelin's gondola is spacious, airy, and comfortable. This photograph was taken inside the gondola of the Eureka, which belonged to California-based Airship Ventures, which has gone out of business. The Eureka was dismantled and its components were sent back to Friedrichshafen, Germany, home of Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, the company that made it, and which designed and is helping Goodyear construct its new zeppelins.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e6263f1e-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/dc62267356dabd3c4e21bdfc5dfc0a12/Loo-with-window_400x600.jpg
Perhaps the most important part of a zeppelin NT is its bathroom, which features a window from which to enjoy the view.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e623539d-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/4081823a8dfdc3bb683697066228d8fc/Rear_of_zeppelin_with_propellers_610x405.jpg
Unlike a traditional Goodyear blimp, which has only two engines, mounted just outside the gondola, a zeppelin has three engines, two of which are on either side of the airship's center, and a third at its very rear. Because it has three engines, a zeppelin can hover like a helicopter.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e620af21-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/04f60b23c36f2961aecdf4955e504740/Side_rotor.jpg
Another advantage of a zeppelin is that its engines can rotate, allowing for much more agile movement.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e61db464-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/33c70bf9c67b93f0a3e34069366beafb/Zeppelin_in_hangar_on_mast_w_truck_610x405.jpg
A zeppelin, seen in the Friedrichshafen, Germany, hangar of  Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik, mounts to a mast that is attached to a long arm off a special truck.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/11/e61a60fa-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/c6ce317889233c1dae0002bdcfa1f89f/Blimp_mast.jpg
A blimp's mast, by comparison, is a much larger, more cumbersome construction, as seen here, with the Spirit of Goodyear linked up to its pyramid-shaped mast at Goodyear's Akron, Ohio, airship operations headquarters.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/05/24/e616fab8-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/3ee75b481ada63e8fbebc26e12540847/Golden_Gate_Bridge_and_Airship_tail_1.jpg
Another advantage -- at least to the passengers -- of a zeppelin, is that its gondola has a large rear window, which allows those on board to see behind the airship. That's how CNET's Daniel Terdiman photographed the Golden Gate Bridge from the now-deconstructed zeppelin Eureka in 2012.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/05/11/e6136e52-f07a-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/ada1c6739fb732910bf1aa7e1fe31c4b/Eclipse.jpg
The silhouette of a zeppelin reveals a much slimmer airship than a traditional Goodyear blimp.
 
[Date]2013-07-15  The Memphis Belle comes back to life
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7aa5f785-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/7fa0f31eee3d2ba4ffe256245bf102f5/Memphis_Belle_from_front.jpg
Now, the plane is being meticulously worked on by the experts in the museum's restoration shop, and CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman stopped by to check out the work during the trip. It is expected that sometime late next year or in early 2015, the plane will be moved inside the museum itself, where the general public will be able to see the final restoration process.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7abc024a-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/0bf0dffd37ea1274243a6c7fbc8cf5dc/Memphis_Belle_in_flight.jpg
In this Air Force photograph, dated June 9, 1943, the Memphis Belle is seen flying over England on its way back to the United States.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7ace34ff-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/3e987df176905a437f3e1b0811644650/Unloading_the_Memphis_Belle.jpg
After arriving at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, home of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force -- and its restoration program -- the Memphis Belle is carefully unloaded in the hangar where the restoration work is done.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7adf5e00-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/1824c417b8c896eac3da24919d466141/Memphis_Belle_from_behind.jpg
The Memphis Belle is seen from behind on July 10, 2013, in the restoration shop at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, outside Dayton, Ohio.

A look at the front (and the right wing) of the Memphis Belle inside the restoration shop.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b08450f-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/3ec0ea0d846e74df2ff87130025252e4/Norden_bomb_sight.jpg
This is a Norden bombsight, mounted in the nose of the Memphis Belle.
According to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, "The Norden bombsight functioned as a part of a whole system. As the bomber approached its target, the bombardier entered data about wind direction, airspeed and altitude into the bombsight's analog computer, which calculated wind drift and provided the correct aim point. An internal gyroscope provided the stability necessary for using the telescopic sight at high altitudes. When connected to the Sperry C-1 Autopilot, the Norden bombsight provided unprecedented accuracy."
Although not original to the plane, this Norden bombsight is representative of what the B-17 flew with in World War II.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b186463-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/6d97be9f8511aeb8d87c1bb6345346c0/Back_from_the_25th_mission.jpg
In this 1943 Air Force photograph, the crew of the Memphis Belle returned to England after completing the plane's 25th mission -- the accomplishment that gained it lasting fame in the annals of U.S. military aircraft.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b289a6a-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/900ec0420d746f9b961971cb07d0bdf0/Nose_art.jpg
In its days barnstorming around the U.S. on a war bond tour, the nose art of the Memphis Belle added the plane's navigators name, as well as eight swastikas representing the Nazi planes it was said to have shot down. But those elements -- unlike the single swastika under the window -- were added after the bomber left Europe.
As part of the restoration, the nose art will be returned to its state when it was flying bombing missions.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b384223-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/cae27182f7fbbd6f52908786bd2836f2/Memphis_Belle_crew.jpg
In this Air Force photo, the crew of the Memphis Belle pose alongside their famous plane. Though the photo shows nose art featuring a series of swastikas, the National Museum of the Air Force's restoration supervisor, Greg Hessler, said that that art was added only once the plane was in the U.S. and was on its war bond tour.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b47ef1f-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/745168f0eebacdc45e2c1d52ef4a8a73/Right_wing_engines.jpg
The Memphis Belle flew with four engines, like these two mounted on the plane's right wing. These are not its original engines, but they are authentic.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b5a49cb-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/0ae6706752a3f5a33b07a9ad1778d485/Propellers.jpg
These are the four propellers that will be mounted on the plane's four engines once the restoration project is done. They are authentic but not original to the plane.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b6ba665-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/3e610be10e7f07fcef140c507cf83af0/Etchings.jpg
Everywhere the Memphis Belle went on its war bond tour, people would scratch their names into the rear of its fuselage. Today, many of those etched names are still visible, but when the restoration is complete, and the plane is painted as it was when it was still flying bombing missions, the names will be painted over.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/14/7b7b4a18-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/c2364ece22e140719284531539a68940/Lt_V_McMahon.jpg
One person to etch his name on the side of the Memphis Belle was Lt. V. McMahon, of New York.

Though no one will ever see this heat exchanger, because it will be closed up inside the Memphis Belle's wing, the restoration crews are bringing the plane's systems back to their original condition -- minus its ability to fly.
 
[Date]2013-07-16 Fixing the smake unit Lionel
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/709a1955-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/29562bae297a4ee0bef5c2199a28754d/Working_on_smoke_unit.jpg
One of the most common repairs is fixing the smoke units on Lionel locomotives, which can easily get damaged due to leaking oil.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/70b0de8b-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/c8d9a7eb41d0989fc92f0d8c998ee411/Pulling_apart_kits_for_parts.jpg
Between 40 percent and 50 percent of all repair work done at the facility is due to some sort of failure by the operators of the trains. Often, owners will demand returns on trains with minor chips, like on the corner of this shell.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/70d43409-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/ca9c9616eca196fec5c882f67284276c/Bins_and_bins.jpg
The Canfield repair facility has about 120,000 parts in its inventory, meaning that it can replace almost any part on any Lionel train made from the mid-1990s and later.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/70e401dc-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/ad1b6c7c74fa0da273a93e4173ca7797/Parts_from_kits.jpg
A worker piles up parts he's gotten from tearing down returned subway cars.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/70f64a87-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/0a015f377aaeb879178dc93dfb95f4d7/Plastic_trucks_grid.jpg
Surprisingly, the Lionel company didn't have a complete register of all the trucks it used in its many sets, leading it to sometimes make brand-new trucks that duplicated ones that already existed.
One of the special projects the Canfield facility has been working on is creating this physical record of every rail truck used on a Lionel train so that the manufacturer can avoid creating new duplicate parts.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/711125a7-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/c2c51ada370baea22838fb06f1214b4b/Locomotive_taken_apart.jpg

When technicians finish a repair, they will usually put the now-fixed product -- be it a locomotive, or a car -- on the testing track and run it around the track for a couple of hours to be sure everything is working properly.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/71305c0a-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/75546c29acde67ddda9a6fd25851b528/Collecting_for_refurb_locomotives.jpg
The repair facility ends up with many locomotive chassis that come from returns. They then hold on to the chassis and use them to build refurbished models, which they sell at a discount.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/71416e89-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/39a4f5f901b6548bf2109a4076f78136/Shelves_of_refurb_locomotive_bodies.jpg

The facility has shelves full of train shells that have been pulled off extensive repairs. The shells are then kept and paired with chassis that need only simple repairs. Often, Lionel can offer someone a shell like this at a much cheaper price than they would pay for a brand-new one.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/15/7197df77-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/77f58f8cae2f0f9f375c2899b71a2524/Shelves_of_shells_close-up.jpg

Just about any paint color that might be needed is kept on hand at the repair facility.

One of the 120,000 parts in the facility's inventory is this one, a tugboat sound board.

Summer is the facility's slow season, since many train enthusiasts are doing other things. If it were high season, these shelves would be full of what are known as "major" projects, which are repairs on high-end, expensive locomotives. Lionel promises that it will take no more than 21 days to complete such repairs, but in practice it usually never takes more than six.

[Date]2013-07-18   With Superhero museum, who needs Comic-Con
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5959cceb-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/d7988684bd1f685ea3852c05521dc8e5/Batman_suit.jpg
The suit was a gift to the museum this year from a man who had purchased it at auction years ago and who was liquidating some of his collection.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/596d42d9-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/3a916740f22082a319ac6d8b7fa2ac41/Hall_of_Heroes.jpg
Opened six years ago, the museum was designed to look like the Hall of Justice from the Superfriends. Much of the collection belongs to Stewart, whose interest in superheroes dates back to the mid-1970s.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/597d2f75-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/a8e2b96d8ebc5a3c3ab6565fde906c4a/Amazing_Fantasy_No_15_-_1st_Spider_Man.jpg
Stewart says that the museum holds 55,000 superhero comic books, including every Marvel book ever produced and every DC book since 1956. So while the museum doesn't yet have an Action Comics No. 1 (the first appearance of Superman), it does have an Amazing Fantasy No. 15, which was the first appearance of Spider-Man.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/598ea73a-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/770cc842d1fe10ca9a7ae270df0ccbac/Spiderman_Twin_towers_poster.jpg
Another rare treasure in the museum is this Spider-Man poster, which depicts the webbed hero and the Twin Towers in New York. The poster was for 2002's "Spider-Man 2" but was recalled after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/59a4c774-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/4cfa7c5378c9370d99c6718717a38391/Captain_America_No_1.jpg
A personal favorite of Stewart's -- which is also quite valuable -- is the museum's copy of Captain America No. 1, in which the superhero is introduced on the cover smashing Adolf Hitler in the face. The book is part of the museum's "golden age" section, which showcases superheroes through comics and other collectibles between 1938 and 1955.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/59b51d93-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/c03f248bb9cf8b31ab1b8a68d160aaea/Batman_No_15_with_gun.jpg
Though Batman is famously anti-gun, that wasn't always the case, as this Batman No. 15 illustrates.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/59c53ce1-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/40b0937dccc029eb41b2455eb8472038/First_Superman_toy.jpg
This is the world's first Superman toy, Stewart said, from 1940. It's a wind-up toy, and when wound, Superman picks up the airplane.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/59d4c585-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/e75872b07c91dd9149de981ccb3ad9ae/One_wall_of_comics.jpg
With 55,000 comic books in its collection, the museum devotes a great deal of space to housing the books, which are presented in alphabetical order. This is just one wall of four of dozens upon dozens of boxes of superhero comic books.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/59e43948-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/1b1a086d8712ec606992d0e54dd0cdb8/Superman_section.jpg
The museum devotes special sections to a few famous superheroes, like this one for Superman.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/59f457f8-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/ef234582e20086b5841e1030f88268f3/Spiderman_section.jpg
There's also, of course, a Spider-Man section.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a195252-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/c594e8be8b4bd5dcecab3b2597dfccc0/Wolverine_exhibit.jpg
The museum usually has a special section set up to celebrate something in the superhero universe. Right now, it's a Wolverine section set up because of the forthcoming "Wolverine" movie.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a29e038-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/a7d75fb4b36ae3e899199c905f442e02/Comics_boxes.jpg
The collection features countless boxes like this one, which all together hold 55,000 superhero comic books, including every book from a major comic book publisher since 1956, Stewart said.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a3d91f4-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/83f499bef2783e443003a1474bc0ca95/Hollywood_heroes_wall.jpg
Another special section depicts superheroes in Hollywood.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a4e9469-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/e2e32b8244fb10a449f5925e16251016/Greatest_American_Hero.jpg
Though not as valuable as the original Batman suit, this is an original Greatest American Hero suit from the 1980s TV show of that name.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a5e2e99-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/aec7baf323e82d540db7e01975e38768/Batman_pedalcar.jpg
This is a Batman pedalcar from England. Stewart said it is the only one of its kind in the United States.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a6dd91b-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/ab825923ccb0b534dbe763c5ef344649/XMen_No_1.jpg
Another important comic book from the collection is this copy of X-Men No. 1.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a7d61da-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/609449c399689200c136a6098532b809/Hall_of_Justice.jpg
Tucked away on a shelf is this Hall of Justice toy set from the Superfriends show. The museum's facade was designed to look like this building.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a8cfdee-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/ac9986de0bb17ede79f8bfca1b0069bd/Green_Lantern_section.jpg
Another superhero with a designated section is the Green Lantern.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/17/5a9db341-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/f3a03640d7ba0a2593fe646708c30335/Hot_Wheels_Invisible_Jet.jpg
One year, Hot Wheels pulled an April Fool's Joke by issuing a press release that it was releasing a Wonder Woman Invisible Jet toy. Later, it put out a small number of the toys.

This is Stewart's Captain America shield. Every year, he dresses up as Captain America in Elkhart's Memorial Day parade, and said that he is usually swarmed by World War II veterans who were often given copies of that hero's comics in their war-time care packages.
 
 
[Date]2013-07-22 A century of the best of the U.S. Air Force
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/1f982eb0-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/a5d24735a128a90da68c95973be37dd2/B-2_from_side.jpg
"With a crew of only two -- the pilot in the left seat and the mission commander in the right -- a typical combat mission consisted of a non-stop flight from Whiteman Air Force Base to the target and back. During these missions, normally lasting more than 30 hours and requiring numerous aerial refuelings, each B-2 delivered up to 40,000 pounds of precision weapons."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/1fab91d2-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/04673215ea19581e239fa1cc0dc0ab50/B-29_Bockscar.jpg
This is Bockscar, the B-29 Superfortress that dropped Fat Man -- the second atomic bomb ever used in warfare -- on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945, effectively ending World War II. The Smithsonian's Air  Space Museum in Washington, D.C. has Enola Gay, which dropped Little Boy on Hiroshima three days earlier.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/1fc207fd-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/6310b0ed61c6fe5c13acf0246152b4fe/SR-71_Blackbird_from_SAC_museum.jpg
This is an SR-71 Blackbird, seen at the Strategic Air Museum in Ashland, Neb. The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force also has a Blackbird, of which there were 32 built. According to the Air Force museum, the SR-71 was "a long-range, advanced, strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed from the Lockheed A-12 and YF-12A aircraft. The first flight of an SR-71 took place on December 22, 1964, and the first SR-71 to enter service was delivered to the 4200th (later 9th) Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base, Calif., in January 1966.
"The U.S. Air Force retired its fleet of SR-71s on Jan. 26, 1990, because of a decreasing defense budget and high costs of operation.
"Throughout its nearly 24-year career, the SR-71 remained the world's fastest and highest-flying operational aircraft. From 80,000 feet, it could survey 100,000 square miles of Earth's surface per hour. On July 28, 1976, an SR-71 set two world records for its class -- an absolute speed record of 2,193.167 mph and an absolute altitude record of 85,068.997 feet."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/1fd20803-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/eb59b0db48ae7f543ef26dc6a82ff746/Observation_balloon.jpg
This Caquot Type R observation balloon from World War I, allowed American military personnel to see up to 40 miles behind enemy lines in a bid to see troop movements or other activity. It was a hydrogen-filled balloon with a gas capacity of 32,200 cubic feet, a length of 92 feet, and a diameter of 32 feet.
It could "lift two passengers in its basket, along with charting and communications equipment," according to the Air Force museum, "plus the weight of its mooring cable, to a height of [up to] 4,000 feet....During WWI, American balloon observers directed artillery fire and targets such as troop concentrations and supply dumps. They noted more than 11,000 enemy airplane sightings, 1,000 instances of military traffic on railroads and roads, and 400 artillery batteries."
A great deal of the Caquot balloons were produced for WWI.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/1fe1d706-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/3566e80109605206703a562f09ebdd9c/Wright_Flyer.jpg
The airplane became "the first military heavier-than-air flying machine," according to the museum. "Upon purchase by the Signal Corps for $30,000 on Aug. 2, 1909, the U.S. Army designated the Wright 1909 Military Flyer as Signal Corps Airplane No. 1, and it remained the only Army airplane for nearly two years."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/1ff19539-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/4cfe037e3d20f5e199b4dd42508e3442/Wind_tunnel.jpg
This 1918 wind tunnel was built at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. "Using a 24-blade fan of 60 inches diameter," according to the Air Force museum, "the tunnel developed a maximum air speed of 453 miles per hour at its 14-inch diameter choke-throat test area.
"It was used for calibrating airspeed instruments and testing airfoils. The item to be evaluated was placed in the choke-throat and viewed through the glass door. During operation, the air was drawn into the small end of the tunnel and exhausted from the large end where the fan was located."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/2001bc06-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/337c398f36ed3be026a1c57e1e34ce0d/Spad_XIII.jpg
With the Germans threatening to win World War I on the strength of their new fighter planes, the American military turned to the French Spad XIII, a small plane with a 220-horsepower engine that, according to the Air Force museum, had a top speed of 135 miles an hour, about ten miles an hour faster than the German fighters. "It carried two .303-cal. Vickers machine guns mounted above the engine," according to the museum. "Each gun had 400 rounds of ammunition, and the pilot could fire the guns separately or together. Technical problems hampered production until late 1917, but nine different companies built a total of 8,472 Spad XIIIs by the time production ceased in 1919.
"Since the United States entered World War I without a combat-ready fighter of its own, the U.S. Army Air Service obtained fighters built by the Allies. After the Nieuport 28 proved unsuitable, the Air Service adopted the Spad XIII as its primary fighter. By the war's end, the Air Service had accepted 893 Spad XIIIs from the French, and these aircraft equipped 15 of the 16 American fighter squadrons."
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/2012206a-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/6b70b2045cee232321f4450febd108e1/Sopwith_Camel.jpg
This is the famous British Sopwith F-1 Camel, which was used to shoot down more enemy planes than any other World War I fighter. The plane went into action for the first time in June 1917, with the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, and two U.S. Army Air Service squadrons also flew the Camel in combat, according to the Air Force museum.
The plane was also used, according to legend, to shoot down the ace pilot Red Baron.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/202434e3-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/93cdae03fe83cc2a63fa824cd0355aeb/Bug.jpg
This is the Kettering Aerial Torpedo, otherwise known as the "Bug," the earliest-ever cruise missile.
According to the museum, it was "launched from a four-wheeled dolly that ran down a portable track [and its] system of internal pre-set pneumatic and electrical controls stabilized and guided it toward a target. After a predetermined length of time, a control closed an electrical circuit, which shut off the engine. Then, the wings were released, causing the Bug to plunge to earth -- where its 180 pounds of explosive detonated on impact."
However, although the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company (founded by the Wright Brothers) made nearly 50 of these weapons, they never saw combat. This is a replica.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/203522bc-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/0cebfa4900e098c1a855b31a87b862f5/MB-2.jpg
The Martin MB-2 "was the first U.S.-designed bomber produced in large numbers," according to the museum. It was ordered in 1920 and replaced British- and Italian-made bombers made in the U.S. under license during the first World War.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/20458b6c-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/a886d70f791e02ee37a9a07a3b5bde17/P-26.jpg
This is a replica of a Boeing P-26A Peashooter, the American military's first-ever monoplane. The planes first flew in March 1932. Eventually, the Air Corps ordered 111 of the Peashooters.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/2055f442-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/feed64d45c910589df9cbdce4f5d9606/B-10.jpg
The Martin B-10 was known to be America's best fighter plane. It was a big leap forward for the military because it had a retractable landing gear and variable pitch propellers. It also had enclosed gun turrets, an enclosed bomb bay, and was faster than any production fighter in the world. This is the last B-10 in the world.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/2067440c-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/c79d47219a84860418d92b1bc700aa72/P-36.jpg
The Curtiss P-36A "Hawk" "was first procured for the Air Corps in 1938," according to the museum. The Army Air Corps purchased a total of 243 P-36s, but by the time World War II began, the plane was outmoded, and was eventually used mainly for training and courier duties at home. This is the Air Corps' first-ever P-36A.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/2076f29e-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/a1fbad49d751ded63a99aeb7a906a529/Doolittle_Raiders_goblets.jpg
"In January, 1942, Gen. Henry 'Hap' Arnold selected Lt. Col. James Doolittle to lead Special Aviation Project No. 1, the bombing of Japan," according to the Air Force Museum. "Although the Doolittle Raid of April 18, 1942, caused only minor damage, it forced the Japanese to recall combat forces for home defense, raised fears among the Japanese civilians, and boosted morale among Americans and our Allies abroad."
In December 1946, Doolittle and the other Raiders met to celebrate his birthday, in the process starting an annual tradition. These 80 silver goblets were presented to the Raiders in 1959 by the city of Tucson, Ariz., each representing one of the men. At the reunions, the surviving men turn their deceased comrades' goblets over, and as of July 2013, there are just three remaining unturned goblets. When only two remain, the final two Raiders will drink a last toast.

This is a rebuilt RB-25D, the plane that Lt. Doolittle flew in his raid on the Japanese.

When the Americans formed their first radar-equipped night fighter squadron in January 1943, they did not have an effective night fighter, according to the museum, so they relied instead on the British Bristol Beaufighter until a plane could be produced at home.

The B-17 Flying Fortress, from World War II, "is one of the most famous airplanes ever built," according to the Air Force museum. It first flew in July 1935 and eventually flew in every World War II combat zone. "It is best known for the daylight strategic bombing of German industrial targets." All told, 12,726 of the planes were built.

This is the German ME-262A, the first operational jet fighter in world history. However, though it could fly very fast, its engines were temperamental and it was slow to accelerate, so the Allies would simply fly large numbers of fighters over German airfields and attack the planes on takeoff. The ME-262A was not destined to help the Germans win the war.

This is an F-86A Sabre, which was the U.S. Air Force's first swept-wing jet fighter. It made its initial flight in October 1947, and the first production model flew in May, 1948, according to the Air Force museum. In September of that year, it set a world speed record of 670.9 miles an hour.
The Sabre was a day fighter and was used in the Korean War, battling Russian-made MiG-15s, eventually shooting down 792 MiGs with a kill ratio of 8:1, according to the museum.

This is a B-52 Stratofortress. According to the Air Force museum, the B-52 became operational in 1955 and for years was the Air Force's main long-range heavy bomber, especially during the Cold War. Indeed, the plane is still operational today with some potentially flying until 2040. Nearly 750 were built, with production ending in 1962. A B-52 dropped the first airborne hydrogen bomb on May 21, 1956, over Bikini Atoll, and in 1965, the planes entered combat in Southeast Asia. "By August 1973, they had flown 126,615 combat sorties with 17 B-52s lost to enemy action," according to the museum.

This is "Patches," a UC-123 Ranch Hand. The planes were used in Southeast Asia, and according to the museum, Ranch Hand crews denied the enemy the ability to ambush vehicles and boats in the jungle by spraying herbicides and defoliating the jungle. "To accomplish the mission, Ranch Hand crews flew [the planes] on straight runs at very low altitude over a well-armed enemy," according to the museum, and the planes were hit regularly, leading to a reputation as the most shot-at Air Force plane in Southeast Asia.

The F-111A was developed to meet the Air Force's need for a new air superiority fighter. The plane had variable-geometry wings, which could be swept forward on takeoff or landing, or during slow-speed flight, according to the Air Force museum.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/217c8901-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/5808395705e5136868a46b2c1759bae2/B-36J_Peacemaker.jpg
The B-36J was known as the Peacemaker. It was designed during World War II, and the plane went operational with Strategic Air Command in 1948. Some of the planes "served as photographic reconnaissance aircraft, and others were adapted to launch and retrieve specially modified RF-84F/K reconnaissance planes."
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/218d5ce2-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/21a297910621db982660a82f7b0ac90d/RF-84K_Thunderflash.jpg
This is an RF-84K Thunderflash, which would have been dropped from a B-36J. The Thunderflash was a reconnaissance and nuclear strike fighter. It had a short range and could not be fueled in mid-air, so being dropped from a B-36J was a way to extend the plane's range, according to the museum.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/21/219debc2-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/1368375168347b8d3c59933ea7421afd/F-84_Thunderstreak.jpg
The F-84F Thunderstreak saw duty during the Berlin crisis in 1961, the year that saw construction begin on the Berlin Wall, with 200 of the planes involved in that pivotal Cold War event.

This is a B-1B Lancer, a multi-role, heavy bomber that first flew in 1984. "The B-1B's blended wing body configuration, variable-geometry design, and turbofan engines combined to provide greater range and high-speed (Mach 1.2) at sea level," according to the museum. "The B1-B employed forward-looking radar and terrain-following radar. it also had an indicator for moving ground targets. Its extremely accurate [GPS], inertial navigation system, Doppler radar, and radar altimeter enabled aircrews to navigate accurately around the world without ground-based navigation aids." The plane was used in combat in 1998, and was also used in Kosovo and Afghanistan, and in 2002, the Air Force began cutting the number of B-1Bs as a cost-saving measure.

Though there are four NAOC planes in the military's fleet, all four are almost never operational at one time. Usually, at least one of the planes is being worked on. But even having three together at once, as seen here, is a somewhat rare event.
The E-4B in the foreground is the one that, when this photograph was taken, is known as the "alert" plane. That means its crew is on a week-long alert and ready to go airborne within minutes, should such a situation arise. Which plane is on alert depends on many factors, among the most important of which is the maintenance schedule.
The planes are also sometimes used to flying the U.S. secretary of defense on international trips.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/17c0ef2d-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/1eca9a4683ce5a4f44860935d8967132/Welcome_aboard.jpg
Anyone going aboard one of the Doomsday planes is greeted with a sign belying the plane's sombre raison d'etre.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/17d0d6e5-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/1e8ebf2b0ca124963fa69c05111d8dd7/Communications_chart.jpg
The NOAC planes are similar to the president's Air Force One but actually have a more sophisticated communications package, including a few more antennae. This chart shows the full range of communications that are possible on board the plane. Essentially, it is outfitted to communicate across the entire range of electromagnetic capabilities in order to ensure that the command and control leadership are able to talk to their forces, regardless of the situation.

This hump, on top of the plane's fuselage, gives those on board the ability to communicate via super high frequency and Milstar systems. According to the Air Force,  Milstar  "is a joint service satellite communications system that provides secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications to meet essential wartime requirements for high priority military users. The multi-satellite constellation links command authorities with a wide variety of resources, including ships, submarines, aircraft and ground stations."

This is the plane's battle staff room -- seen through a window, as CNET was not allowed to takes photographs while inside the room. When the plane is on alert, the room would be full with officers from each of the United States' military services. The goal is to staff the room with officers who understand the country's big-picture strategic situation, as well as national, state, and local infrastructure, including power grids.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/1828e7e8-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/3384793012f7bc2cfc9495a30cedb414/Briefing_room.jpg
Because the plane sometimes carries the secretary of defense or other senior military leaders, it has a briefing room for traveling press.

Among the plane's many communications tools is a very-low frequency antenna that can be trailed out the back of the aircraft. Depending on need, the antenna can be as much as five miles long. Technicians can monitor the antenna from this station, and see it physically through the white periscope that is on the left side of the station. It is vital that the technicians monitor the antenna when it is outside the plane because it is fragile and can be damaged or destroyed in rough weather or turbulence.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/18bb94d6-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/2326413364704527e5b3453109e78879/VLF_antenna_spool.jpg

The plane has a number of bunks for crew rest. If necessary, the Doomsday planes can be refueled while aloft, extending their flying time to well more than ten hours.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/18e294e4-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/af52d7eb473486a78c036c79c2306c73/SecDef_quarters.jpg
While the NAOC planes are designed to provide airborne command and control functionality in case of a major military crisis, they are also used to fly the Secretary of Defense on international missions. When the Secretary is aboard, this is his dedicated compartment. It includes a bunk, and several chairs, a desk, and video screens.
If the plane is flying without the Secretary aboard, the compartment can be used by other senior officers.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/18f5dea3-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/452bf9a5f747f22cb2a313aa367f3c61/Conference_room.jpg
Located just outside the secretary of defense's quarters, this conference room is set up to facilitate live video conferences, as well as all the other forms of communications the plane provides and enables. When aboard, the secretary will often use the room for long meetings.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/1909685b-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/b9e8954eac2d44a7620714ff26761f59/Logo.jpg

This is the plane's cockpit. With a few minor differences, it is essentially the same as on any Boeing 747-200.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/19366bd4-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/d8e9887892817e73ce4c2258b450640d/Flight_engineer_console.jpg
This is the flight engineer's console. On Boeing 747-400s and 747-8 Intercontinentals, there is no flight engineer, with most of that role's functions having been automated. Air Force One is also a modified 747-200.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/22/1949df78-f693-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/b92142e38ce2556ba46df6f3e8790501/Generators_panel.jpg
One major difference between the NAOC planes and a standard 747-200 is that the Doomsday aircraft have eight generators, with two for each engine. A normal 747-200 has only one generator per engine. This area of the flight engineer's console shows the status and provides control over those eight generators.

The great triumph of the columns, which are also collectively known as a lily pad, is that they effortlessly hold up the roof, allowing for walls made partially of glass tubes -- a design that allows a great deal of natural light to flood the space during the day.

Though the SC Johnson company was fully on board with Wright's design, there was just one problem: the Wisconsin Industrial Commission couldn't believe that the 21-foot-tall columns meant to hold up the building's roof, which were just nine inches in diameter at the base, could possibly carry such a load. As a result, they denied permission for the great master to proceed.
 
Seventy-four years after the building's opening, one might wonder how Wright convinced the commission to change its mind. The answer: He had workers pile as much as 60 tons of sandbags on top of one of the columns, which only needed to hold 12 tons under his design.
 
By the end of the demonstration, seen here in a photograph from 1937, the commission reversed its decision in less than 24 hours, and the building became part of American's great architectural heritage.

Thanks to the masterful design of the columns, the roof and walls of the SC Johnson administration building didn't need to have structural supports spaced along the walls, as most buildings did. That allowed Wright to build in long sections high on the walls with glass tubing that let in natural light from the outside.

Another highlight of the SC Johnson headquarters is this walkway, which connects the administration building -- opened in 1939 -- with the research and development building, which opened in 1950 as Wright's second major commission for the family-owned company.

The administration building is full of aesthetic surprises, like this second-floor seating area, which sticks out over the main floor, and which is underneath one of the signature lily pad-like columns.

Wright is famous for the art glass he often used in houses he built in urban environments, glass that let in natural light, but which provided privacy for those inside.
 
At the SC Johnson headquarters in Racine, Wright used a similar concept -- artistic glass, made out of tubes, that let in natural light, but kept what went on inside the building private.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/25/e45dc322-f68d-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/2da6590c10cb2707bad1acb0789fdc72/Second_level_lightwell_long_view.jpg

Bathrooms are located below the Great Workroom, meaning that employees who need to use the restroom must climb down this spiral staircase.

Though some use the stairs, employees in the administration building can also take the elevator. This is the Wright-designed elevator cage.

To this day, employees who work in the SC Johnson headquarters administration building sit at desks designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, like this one. The desks have three levels, like the building, and have Wright's famous linear aesthetic.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/25/e4c1e5ed-f68d-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/12e89abcf9890d9eaee1da015741a5d0/Desk_with_swing_drawer_pulled_out.jpg

Wright also designed three-legged chairs for the company's employees, but after many workers had trouble keeping from tipping over, Wright agreed to design a four-legged version.

Though the Great Workroom is flooded in natural light during the day, it does require lighting when it gets dark.

Today, the R&D building is being fully restored, after years of use took a heavy toll on the building's brick facade and the glass tubing that was used to let in large amounts of natural light. This is what the building looked like before the restoration began.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/25/e50b30b4-f68d-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/56c541b3d4ce301556a1c24833b45bd1/Tubes_view_and_no_view.jpg
The RD building was designed with glass tubing around its entire exterior, allowing natural light to flood in. But the years have taken their toll on the building, and now, its brick and glass facades are being restored and replaced.
 
Here, we see a section along one wall where some of the tubing has already been replaced with all-new glass, while some has yet to be fitted. That means that, for the moment, there is a view out of the building that will never again be possible once all the new tubing is installed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/25/e51bdd86-f68d-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/5b05c103eccb156f2b76541025db55e0/Tubes_cleaned_in_place.jpg
The key to installing the new -- and restored -- glass tubing is mounting them on special gaskets along the building's side, as seen here.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/25/e52bbd32-f68d-11e2-8262-0291187b029a/thumbnail/770x578/769b77803213c04db8dc37a3173c72ff/Old_gasket.jpg
This is an original gasket from the building, which has been taken off for cleaning. Once cleaned, it will be remounted in order to have tubing fitted over it.

Though much of the straight tubing on the building's sides is being entirely replaced, SC Johnson decided to keep the curved tubes that were mounted on the building's corners. As a result, workers are meticulously cleaning these tubes. This is a stack of the curved tubes, which are awaiting cleaning.

These curved tubes have already been cleaned and are now marked so that workers know exactly where they are supposed to be re-mounted.

NORTH PLATTE, Neb. -- The Union Pacific's Bailey Yard
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/26/0f20f490-f7f0-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/0f328491c0719f84b06e285be83392f5/East_Hump.jpg
A major component of Bailey Yard is the East Hump, where every day, more than 1,500 rail cars are sorted, taken off one train, and re-routed to another. Locomotives push the cars up a 34-feet-tall mound, where they are then separated and sent downhill, one at a time, onto one of dozens of "bowl" tracks -- each of which represents a specific eastern destination.
A corresponding West Hump is also used to used to sort cars heading west, but because most traffic heads east, the bulk goes through the East hump. In addition, the West hump mound is only 20 feet high.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/27/0f89ad84-f7f0-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/2b4ce50886e3d95b2a13343881cf30b3/Screen_shot_2013-07-27_at_10.49.48_AM.png
A look at the aerial view of Bailey Yard, from Google Maps. The yard covers 2,850 acres, and has 114 tracks designated for specific destinations.

Rail cars headed to the West hump to be separated are pushed uphill.

Locomotive number Y823 slowly pushes rail cars uphill towards the West hump. Because many westbound cars are empty, or at least carrying lighter loads than their eastbound counterparts, less locomotives are needed to push the cars towards the West hump than for the East hump.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/26/11661db7-f7f0-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/fe4b32bc9742734f6865a5d5b54845d5/Disconnecting_at_East_Hump.jpg
A Bailey Yard worker manually pulls a handle to separate a car from a train at the top of the East hump.

After the cars are separated, they roll gently downhill using only gravity toward their designated bowl track. When they pass a so-called "retarder," their wheels are squeezed hard enough to slow them down so that they roll easily and safely onto the proper track for their eventual destination. A computer routes the cars onto the proper track.

A closer look at a retarder, which is used to slow the railcars down as they roll unimpeded downhill towards their designated bowl track where they will connect with their intended train at 4 miles an hour or less.

Often, when trains come into Bailey Yard, their rail cars are separated from the locomotives and are sent off to one of the humps to be re-directed to trains heading to their eventual destination. While that happens, the locomotives are brought to the diesel yard to be serviced.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/26/174988ce-f7f0-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/5036c3f696f9248cbb8a4c855693e3a9/Train_cars_as_far_as_you_can_see.jpg
Though Bailey Yard is off limits to the general public, visitors can climb the Golden Spike observation tower, where they can get a panoramic view of the world's largest rail yard. From the top of the tower, they can see rail cars all the way to the horizon.

Many locomotives heading east are sent through the East service track, where they are loaded up with, among other things, sand that they will use to gain traction when their steel wheels slip on the steel tracks. The sand is shot onto the tracks using nozzles mounted at the wheels.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/26/1b49e6ff-f7f0-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/16a23e071def8e82f3957fa3bd609db0/East_service_sand_tower.jpg
This large tower along side the East service track is filled with sand, which is loaded into special tanks on the locomotives using cranes.

Hours before the Brickyard 400, one of Nascar's biggest races, each of the 43 cars that were taking part in the competition lined up to be scanned. Once a car passes the examination, it has a sticker placed on it, and a Nascar official stays with the vehicle until the race begins to ensure that no one tries to modify the car in any disallowed way.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/30/93694fab-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/1cc3b02b32837f4b9c9aa2140b8b4bc1/Calibration_plate.jpg
When a car is on the scanner, it has plates like this one placed on each of its wheels. These are used in conjunction with lasers in order to ensure that the measurements that are made are highly accurate. Because Nascar aims for a level playing field, it wants each car to hit the race track with specifications that meet the sport's standards. Essentially, it wants the drivers to be the difference in who wins or loses, not the cars.

In 2013, Nascar rolled out its so-called "Gen 6" car, an all-new vehicle that aims to be lighter and safer than the previous version, which was used from 2007 to 2012, while also doing away with the uniform look of all manufacturers' cars that fans didn't like.
The new design has 17 main elements, not all new, as demonstrated by this Nascar chart: A radiation air intake; brake air intakes; hood pins; cowl induction; body panels; a roll cage; a jack post; double frame rail and energy absorbing material; a window net; roof strips; a TV camera; roof flaps; jacking bolts; cooling vents; Goodyear Eagle racing tires; rear deck fins; and a rear spoiler.

Nascar drivers must endure several hours of driving at break-neck speeds crammed inside a narrow cockpit like this one.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/30/9372501f-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/5238c29823bd8a0dda896d51aae120d7/Tear-off_windshields.jpg
Rather than having teams spend precious racing time cleaning off windshields that have gotten messy between pit stops, they can simply tear off a layer and expose a fresh windshield. The cars are fitted with seven layers of tear-off windshield before the race.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/30/93736dad-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/9237ea46fac11943fa4475be02d22ac5/Tear-off_windshield_torn_off.jpg
One of the tear-off windshield layers is seen crumpled up in pit row after being ripped off during a pit stop.

This roof flap is a design meant to help cars remain stable even in a spin-out. Previously, Nascar vehicles risked taking air if they spun out at full-speed, and while that's still a danger, the roof flaps are meant to help reduce that risk.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/07/30/93758fac-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/05973421afcb7b8fe7ed3327c5a6f194/Clear_spoiler.jpg
Another aerodynamic feature of the cars is this clear spoiler on the side of the rear-hood.

If a car's engine is running too hot during a race, the team can rip these strips off the radiator air intake, letting in more air and cooling the engine down.

Ryan Newman (No. 39) and Jimmie Johnson (No. 48) at the front of the Brickyard 400 field at the beginning of the Sprint Cup Series race on Sunday, July 28, 2013. Newman won the race's pole position with a track record speed of 187.531 miles an hour, not even a tenth of a mile per hour better than second-position starter Johnson, who had earlier set a track record of his own with a qualifying speed of 187.438 miles an hour.

Jimmie Johnson, who was considered the favorite at this year's Brickyard 400 after having won four previous races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, tears around the track during his qualifying run on Saturday, July 27, 2013. His speed of 187.438 miles an hour set a track record, breaking one that had lasted since 2004. But Ryan Newman broke Johnson's record less than an hour later, besting his speed with a 187.531 mile an hour performance.

Here is Terrafugia's promotional blurb for its $279,000 hybrid:
"The Transition is the transportation of the future today. A street-legal airplane that converts between flying and driving modes in under a minute, the Transition brings a new level of freedom, flexibility, and fun to personal aviation.
"It gives the pilot the option to land and drive in bad weather, provides integrated ground transportation on both ends of the flight, and fits in a standard single car garage at home. The Transition can fly in and out of over 5,000 public airports in the U.S. and is legal to drive on public roads and highways.
"It is the only light aircraft designed to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and it is also equipped with a full-vehicle parachute for additional safety."

The Transition sits along the flight line at OshKosh, preparing for its demonstration flight. Its wings unfolded, as they must be for flying.
The plane has a top speed of about 100 miles an hour, and has a range of about 410 miles. It gets about five gallons per hour in the sky, and 35 miles per gallon on the highway.

As the Transition flies above the crowd of thousands at sunset, it catches a few last rays of the gorgeous Wisconsin sun.
The Transition features automated electromechanical folding, rear wheel drive on the road, and automotive style entry, exit, and seating. It doesn't need a hangar since it can fit in a standard house garage. It also has both a steering wheel and stick and rudders.

The Transition is seen in the air with its right side to the crowd.
The flying car can be driven to a location if it can't fly because of inclement weather, and has a 100 hp Rotax 912iS engine. It also features a vehicle parachute, and modern glass avionics, Terrafugia says, as well as standard automotive crash safety features including driver and passenger air bags.

One of Stratcom's many missions is the National Airborne Operations Center, known colloquially as the Doomsday plane, which military leaders would use to conduct operations in case of a crisis such as a nuclear war. There are four NAOC planes, which are operated by the 55th Air Wing at Offutt Air Force Base.

ST. LOUIS -- It's a rare museum that has a school bus hanging off the roof, let alone a bus that kids can climb on. But at the City Museum here, that's just one small piece of the fun.

With the school bus hanging off the edge of the giant warehouse building, the City Museum is impossible to ignore, even from a block away. Cassilly's vision included giving visitors a chance to go beyond the usual things they're allowed to do in public places and to have a great time doing so. After all, who else would allow visitors to climb on a bus sticking out into open space or through a tunnel high over the heads of others?

In the 1920s, the warehouse that is home to the City Museum was the world's largest shoe distributor, and it used these spiral slides to send shoes from the upper floors to those below. Today, it's a slide used by endless numbers of kids -- and adults -- to gleefully shoot from the upper floors to the bottom.

Who wouldn't want to spend a few hours at a "museum" that announces itself with a huge airplane on a tower and a long open-air tunnel that anyone can crawl through -- if they're comfortable crawling through a tunnel high over the heads of other visitors.

Everything in the City Museum is reused in some way, and its director, Rick Erwin, is constantly making trips to salvage sales in St. Louis and other cities on the lookout for unwanted goods that would make for exciting new elements of the City Museum.
This tower -- and elephant -- are on the top of the building's roof, and have quite a view of downtown St. Louis. y

Another attraction on the City Museum's roof is this Ferris wheel, which both kids and adults can ride. The museum is planning to install a kids-only Ferris wheel inside a dome on the roof of the building.

Rick Erwin, the City Museum director, said that at any given time, there are several new projects under way, including six at the moment. This Egyptian sarcophagus is one of them. Erwin said that he decided that a new Egyptian-themed area had to look like a sarcophagus, and so his builders made the entrance to the space have five-foot-thick walls.

If a giant needed to take the SAT, he or she might use this pencil, the world's largest. At 76 feet long and a weight of 21,500 pounds, this pencil can actually write -- and erase. And since it used No. 2 lead, it could be used, if someone could lift it and write with it, to take a standardized test. It was created by artist Ashrita Furman.
All told, this mammoth pencil contains 4,000 pounds of Pennsylvania graphite and is the equivalent of 1.9 million normal pencils. Its eraser is made of rubber and weighs 250 pounds.

This is the world's largest pair of underwear, found in the City Museum's area known as the Museum of Mirth, Mystery and Mayhem. Not long ago, the underpants were stolen, only to reappear about a month later, washed, and accompanied by a matching woman's pair.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/05/06268eda-0627-11e3-bf02-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a78488e0d8b0aa0ef4734d00fb8ade1e/Kids_climbing_1.jpg
If the City Museum isn't filled with the screams and shrieks of happy children running around and climbing up into various tubes and tunnels, or disappearing into mysterious holes in the floor, then it isn't open for business. Everywhere you look there are different passageways and compartments for people -- kids and adults -- to crawl through, over, below, and into.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/05/0633f174-0627-11e3-bf02-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/770x578/a60058afd1456615028199cbb4dce3d8/Shoelace_factory.jpg
One interesting element of the City Museum is that it invites a number of entrepreneurs to open up small businesses inside. Those can range from small eateries to this, a shoelace factory. Using equipment from the building's past, the factory's owner makes brightly-hued laces to sell. Visitors can buy a pair, or just watch as the machinery, which once made laces for World War II soldiers, turns out pair after pair.

There are probably too many different slides and tunnels to count at the City Museum. That's no doubt true because builders there are always looking for places to add new tunnels or passageways.

MonstroCity, a special outdoor section of the City Museum, is "a captivating collision of old and new, architectural castoffs and post-apocalyptic chaos....It is is at once interactive sculpture and playground. Comprised of wrought iron slinkies, fire trucks, stone turrets, airplane fuselages, slides of all sizes and shapes, and a pair of ball pits modeled after the Thunderdome, MonstroCity inspires a child-like sense of bravado in guests of all ages."
 
[Date]2013-08-08  Road to Indy: The life of a Goodyear racing tire
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f4fb97a-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/34412172456322ca9589257792ac4b94/Indy_-_pit_stop_rolling_tire_off_car.jpg
When you buy a set of new Goodyear tires for your car, you have every reason to expect that they'll last you 80,000 miles. But when a Nascar team gets its hands on a set of Goodyear's racing tires, the expectation is a little lower: just 100 miles.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f50e2a6-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/25d8fbab2af4f73bf5973acd022030a1/Pressing_rubber.jpg
In order to produce a racing tire's tread, Goodyear workers run what's known as green rubber through a machine called an extruder. There, the rubber is heated and blended to the point that it's soft enough to formed. At that point, it's run through a die, which pushes out a long, continuous strip of rubber.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f5203bf-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/706556cee9f90a804fff7b75ba70ca99/Sheets_coming_off_machine.jpg
Heated rubber, forming a continuous strip, is pushed through the die. After making its way through the extruder, the rubber is laser-measured to make certain that its shape meets engineers' specifications. It's then sent down a conveyor belt to be cooled and cut to the desired length.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/07/8f5322ec-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/58b1953be6641f4cab1f537aabc72524/M-building_edges.jpg
Additional components of a tire, like its belts, are manufactured in a machine known as a calender. There, large rolls of nylon, aramid, and fiberglass are fed into the machine, where they have a rubber coating added to each side and between each individual cord. The goal is to completely encapsulate each cord in rubber.
This is the bead, a hoop-shaped tire component, two of which go in each tire. The bead is the rigid part of the tire that keep it held firmly to the wheel. The bead also gives the tire its round-shaped opening. The bead is made by encapsulating high-tensile steel wire in rubber and winding it around what's known as a mandrel into a hoop shape.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f5443a8-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/e21d663c621f2efbe7825e2974ca32fd/M-layering.jpg
After making all the different tire components, they are moved to a tire building machine, where highly-trained builders assemble the tires by hand. Known here as "green tires," they are constructed in two separate sections -- the carcass, which provides the load-carrying capability of a racing tire; and the belt package, which is responsible for the shape and footprint of the tire at high speeds.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f555cdd-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/bb0685d9eab09056fe5efede60005ebf/M-Adding_thicker_outer_layers.jpg
In order to make a carcass, the builder begins with an interliner made of rubber, which is designed to keep air sealed inside the tire when it's inflated. After that, the rubber-coated fabric piles, which were manufactured at the calender, are added to the inner liner. This gives the tire its shape.
Next, the beads and other components are added, stiffening the sidewall.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f567f52-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/e3ff66ca108335de87529df52311b4f7/M-inflated.jpg
Next, an airbag in the machine inflates, giving the tire a shape nearly identical to what its final dimensions will be. Doing this makes it possible to put the tire's many components in the proper position before the tire is cured.
A tire builder will also create the belt package at this point, adding two belts applied at diagonal angles, and folded over each other to increase strength. As well, a small fabric strip known as an overlay, is wound around the tire, helping to reinforce the tire's shape and structure at high speeds.
Lastly, a one-eighth of an inch-thick strip of tread is added. The tread is that thin because a racing tire is designed for heat resistance and grip rather than a long tread life.
Finally, the carcass and the belt packaged are put together, and an automatic roller presses them together. It is now a "green tire," and a barcode sticker is applied.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f57a1b2-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/21efd22bb07b61c78b1708060e1a694f/Applying_RFID.jpg
Nascar tracks tires at every step of the way, from delivery to the teams to the race, and beyond. To do so, they track RFID tags that are applied as the final step in the green tire's assembly.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f58b1f7-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/52eac77c88a55c13b5ae201ba2bcfbaf/Curing.jpg
The green tires are then taken to a curing press, where a hot mold closes around the tire, and an airbag inflates insides, providing the tire's shape. This process vulcanizes the rubber through the application of specified and tightly-regulated amounts of heat and pressure.
Lastly, the curing press opens and the tires are taken out and moved to a conveyor that takes them to an inflation machine. There, it is inflated for 30 minutes in order to retain its shape and size during the cooling process.

After the manufacturing process, the tires are eventually shipped to one of the many Nascar races held throughout the United States each year. Generally, there's about a 30-day lag between production and the race.
According to Nascar rules, each team participating in a Sprint Cup Series race -- which is Nascar's major leagues -- can use up to 10 or 11 sets or tires, depending on the race. The tires are not all the same, however. Right-side tires are about an eighth of an inch larger than left-side tires and usually have higher pressure, which helps cars in the turns on a racetrack stay stable
This wall of tires is outside the Goodyear garage at the Indianapolis Motorspeedway prior to the Brickyard 400. Typically, Goodyear brings about 4,500 tires to each Nascar race.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f5c098f-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/fcb476aa12888ca64231cbd75ee47c5c/Indy-Fitting_tires_on_wheels.jpg
Goodyear delivers all its tires to the racing teams mounted on wheels. The goal, as with much of what Nascar mandates when it comes to racing specifications, is to ensure that each team is on a level playing field, regardless of its financial resources.
Here, Goodyear crew members mount the tires on wheels using special machines.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f5d1b98-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/84a0d85b255c01e079f48a098d623968/Indy-inner_tire.jpg
On any racing track longer than a mile, Nascar requires that cars use tires featuring a tubeless inner tire designed to allow the driver to make it safely back to the pit in case of a flat.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f5e2c49-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/b54a77e5f76d43f933bfe397e6b39601/Indy_-_2_car_tire_on_white_wheel.jpg
While most Nascar teams use black wheels, the No. 2 car, driven by Brad Keselowski, sports white. Keselowski's tires for the 2013 Brickyard 400 are seen piled up outside Goodyear's garage at the Indianapolis Motorspeedway.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f5f3c94-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/50c0cc9a0f04276fea2cbde2aa25559d/Indy_-_2_valves.jpg
On one of Keselowski's wheels, you can see the two valves that belong both to the main tire and to its tubeless inner tire.

Nascar favorite Dale Ernhardt Jr.'s No. 88 car is seen being pushed back off the track after he completed his qualifying run the day before the Brickyard 400.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f62772e-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/8764ddad222b7528b0261e99a8a8b49d/Indy_-_left_and_right_tires_laid_out_pit.jpg
In the pit area, a racing team has laid out two sets of Goodyear racing tires, with the right and left tires designated by different color strips. Goodyear's right-side racing tires are slightly bigger and often are filled to a higher pressure than the left side tires. That's helps keeps the cars stable as they go left around every curve on the track.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f639083-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/a20227408f97581ac50b0ce7f106573a/Indy_-_worn_tire.jpg
Most Nascar teams replace their cars' tires every time they refuel, which is about every 100 miles. This is what a tire looks like after being pulled off a race car at a Nascar event. Note the rough surface, which used to be very smooth and unmarked.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/06/8f64a002-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/b883f87144ea3119aae90bcb5c48514c/Indy_-_rolling_worn_tires_out_of_pit.jpg

Earnhardt's crew races through a pit stop, replacing No. 88's tires. During the Brickyard 400, Earnhardt lost his position early in the race due to a loose wheel. But he eventually managed to make up most of his lost time and finished in sixth place after falling all the way to last place.

A team member uses a special tool to measure the wear on a tire that has been pulled off a car during a pit stop. The teams -- and Nascar -- keep close track of data like this because it tells them a lot about how the drivers are performing, as well as how the tires do under the extreme conditions of a Nascar race.

[Date]2013-08-17   Taliesin: At home with Frank Lloyd Wright
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b92506a-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/608d0057957b35e742cf49a7f61c2a2b/Courtyard_fountain.jpg
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b9384be-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/43a29e83dd994a5f8c7091899d907292/Exterior_on_approach.jpg
Wright lived in Oak Park, Ill., where he had set up his architectural firm. But when he fell in love with Mamah Borthwick, the wife of a client, he moved -- along with his mistress -- to Spring Green. He built the main house on the Taliesin estate -- which means "shining brow" in Welsh -- for Borthwick, completing it in 1911.
 
Though the house was first completed that year, it has been evolving ever since, in part because Wright had to contend with two major fires, but also because even after his death, Taliesin has continued to evolve as a showpiece of architecture and of the famous architect himself.

The main house at Taliesin is full of trademark Wright touches, like this long walkway that sticks out off the side of the house.

A view of the walkway that allowed those inside to walk well out away from the building and into what would appear to be wide open space, despite the walkway resting on a stone pillar below.

The main house features a small courtyard, garden, and fountain just below a set of stairs that lead to the rolling hills and fields of the Taliesin estate to the south.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b98da6d-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/3711df22d06c2ba78a10cd1076a18cee/House_from_above.jpg
The main house at Taliesin was built to blend into the landscape, as so many of Wright's buildings were.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b99eb4b-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/8adda6f30aadfbfb29796690c42d5ad8/Lamp.jpg

One of Wright's most exquisite rooms is the living room in the main house at Taliesin, a room that is at once vast and intimate. What's not evident to the naked eye is that Wright expanded the room at the point of the pillar on the far wall after a fire. Originally the pillar was where the wall was.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b9c0b9d-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/bd353dc60e5026647426eae00807fba1/Living_room_view.jpg
One of the most elegant elements of the living room is the wide open view of the peaceful and stunningly beautiful local landscape, hills, and valleys. Taliesin was built in the middle of a large, untouched area of nature, and Wright wanted everyone who visited -- or lived there -- to be able to enjoy that nature from the house's main living space.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b9d23b8-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/02b347dcfe78f7f47277869e2735b055/Courtyard.jpg
A look back at the main house across the courtyard and its gardens.

Wright fans may at first think that the living room is cantilevered over the hillside, which almost seems to disappear as it drops below the house. But in fact, Wright built the house into the side of the hill, cleverly using the shape of the landscape to serve his architectural and engineering purposes.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8b9f56c8-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/46fed6ed569d2fb9570a9993f3cff851/Wrights_bedroom.jpg
A look at Wright's bedroom.

After Mamah Borthwick died in the 1914 fire, Wright married twice more, finally taking Olga Ivanovna Lazovich as his wife. Her tastes were different than those of Wright, as her bedroom shows. Where Wright's style was complex and layered -- as evidenced by the masonry on the room's back wall, her aesthetic tended to more simple style, as the hearth in her bedroom shows.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8ba17a4b-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/634735896d1f156fb59b08eb8857df13/Grave_1.jpg
Although Wright died in Phoenix, Ariz., he was buried in the small cemetery on the Taliesin grounds, along with other family members. This is his grave.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8ba28d3e-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/1bf58faaf58a308ebd657c7162351fbf/Grave_2.jpg
Rather than a headstone, Wright's grave is marked by a piece of metalwork reminiscent of the geometric design style familiar to those who know his art glass windows.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8ba39bbe-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/a7388bb22a2ae32335d3046509e3692e/Tower.jpg
This is the Romeo  Juliet tower on the Taliesin estate. It was the first structure that Wright ever designed. Built in 1896 for his aunts Jane and Nell Lloyd Jones, it was only supposed to last for 25 years. Instead, it stood until 1990, when it was significantly rebuilt.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/16/8ba4b34c-6788-11e3-846b-14feb5ca9861/thumbnail/770x578/7e9cf4be9d73b3bb0cd90a9902375ae8/Architecture_school_interior.jpg
As at Wright's Arizona home Taliesin West, he maintained an architecture school at Taliesin in Wisconsin. To this day, students study at the school.

As in so many of Wright's buildings, the main house at Taliesin features a long, narrow hallway that opens into a large room at the end.

Based on a simple 1972 Ford Van, this is Starbird's "Vantasta." Made from hand-shaped metal, the vehicle was among the very first to feature a futuristic nose. The van has a mid-engine 350 Chevy engine. Inside, there's a stereo, a TV, a bar, a bed, and a two-person cockpit. It's painted in House of Color Pearl and Graphics.Starbird got his start building custom cars in 1954 at the Star Custom Shop. His first project was a 1947 Cadillac. Right off the bat, he got his work in a magazine. His career took off from there.

An aerial view of Darryl Starbird's National Hot Rod &amp; Custom Car Hall of Fame Museum, outside Afton, Okla. Shot using a DJI Phantom 2 Vision +.In the beginning, the heart of the hot rod community was on the West Coast. Folks like Batmobile creator were getting Hollywood excited about the culture. But out in Kansas, Starbird was quietly becoming one of the most important voices in the community. In 1959, he produced his first car show. Today, he said he’s done 440 around the country, most of which have been in middle America, although he also produces them in places like San Francisco and Oakland, Calif.

[Date]2014-06-18  Dalas JFK
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/16/e74b18dd-0a91-4f6c-badd-9dcb9b3f1d9b/thumbnail/770x578/49488732992866df34d8d4bd550da464/fbi-model-wide.png
Among the compelling exhibits is the above FBI-created model of the
president's motorcade moving down Elm Street at the moment Kennedy was shot.
Made to determine whether it was possible JFK had been shot by presumed
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald from the sixth floor of the book depository, the
model establishes that the official explanation is at least plausible.

Although the trees along Elm Street are taller than they were in 1963, a look out the sixth floor window of the book depository is a chilling experience. From the window, it is possible to visualize Kennedy's motorcade route, with his limousine first moving slowly down Houston Street (on the left) and then making the sharp turn downhill on Elm, where he was eventually shot.

A look up Elm Street toward what was in 1963 the Texas School Book Depository, and which is now the home of the Sixth Floor Museum (left). The X on the pavement is said to mark the exact spot where Kennedy was fatally wounded.

Called the most famous home movie in history, the short film shot by Abraham Zapruder on November 22, 1963 was the only known footage to show the assassination. It was used as evidence in many of the investigations surrounding Kennedy's murder.This is the exact view Zapruder had on that fateful day.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/16/dd8a1a7b-8c89-4a42-b933-5226bdebf244/thumbnail/770x578/07993c9db6dce697409c55a83f0cfe45/exhibitrifle-location.jpg
This is a replica of the 6.5mm Mannlicher-Carcano rifle said to have been used by Lee Harvey Oswald to kill Kennedy. Located in the Sixth Floor Museum next to stacks of replica boxes meant to depict the scene at the spot where Oswald allegedly fired the killing shots, the weapon is one of the most startling artifacts in the museum.

A seven-story brick building that would otherwise have no notoriety, the former Texas School Book Depository is now one of the most infamous structures in American history. Today it houses the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, a history of President Kennedy and his assassination.

A close-up look at the FBI's model re-creating the supposed wound and kill shots said to have been fired by Lee Harvey Oswald from the sixth floor of what was in 1963 the Texas School Book Depository. The white wires are meant to establish that there was direct line of sight to Kennedy for both shots.

Many people refuse to accept the official theory that Oswald was the lone assassin. A number of witnesses said they heard shots from what is now known as the "Grassy Knoll," this spot alongside Dealey Plaza on the west side of Elm Street.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/16/316aaff9-38ba-4171-a7e3-f84486873aae/thumbnail/770x578/998cba2a0c8522db8705616328e7c5d0/exhibitbob-jackson-camera.jpg
This is the camera used by the Dallas Times Herald's Bob Jackson to capture the famous photograph of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald two days after the Kennedy assassination. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize.The camera is on display at the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas.

[Date]2014-06-19     South West Airline headquater, Dallas
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/dc00db4c-9bab-4fe6-b032-72092e6e32c1/thumbnail/770x578/158454b79228bb533a2d30a8742793de/poolie-with-smoke.jpg
At its Dallas headquarters, Southwest runs this cabin trainer, known as the Poolie, which lets the flight crew practice what to do in a crisis
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/b0a54086-df28-40cd-a9da-7e3154563ce2/thumbnail/770x578/164261ad16c427515e44175773f564b3/poolie-from-side.jpg
Southwest bought the cabin trainer, which mimics part of the interior of a Boeing 737, from Carnival Airlines in 1985. The airline repainted the trainer with its new livery last year.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/71daf5cf-e57f-4b10-a262-127e85e788c1/thumbnail/770x578/4f503a3496c29fa463f4aa43ce1604f6/poolie.jpg
The interior of the Poolie just prior to the cabin filling up with fake smoke. As you can see, it looks very much like an older Southwest 737.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/a5e0058e-4e3e-4c1b-a9aa-57286d2fb3a7/thumbnail/770x578/51ac5fc816a7aff92e16071348655156/poolie-with-slide.jpg
Part of the emergency exercise for those training in the Poolie is to guide "passengers" down the slide that inflates in the case of a crisis. Here, we see the trainer with the slide extended after a demonstration. The exit door had been open during the demo.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/5c1daa9b-059f-4aa3-9e67-c8af57979d41/thumbnail/770x578/4a866258ad1689932346f8d7dbfef9aa/line-of-flight-simulators.jpg
Southwest maintains nine flight simulators at its Dallas headquarters. All first officers and captains must train in them once a year. The giant simulators are meant to pitch and roll just as a plane would, depending on the scenario. The nine simulators are almost always all in use.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/a23afeea-55b6-49ad-a944-ef6421d52692/thumbnail/770x578/39dee4293d44dde3dd15e55f1c281ed6/all-electric-flight-simulators.jpg
While most of the flight simulators use hydraulics to move, the airline's two newest are all-electric. All nine of the trainers simulate Boeing 737s, although two of them (not pictured here) represent the oldest 737s in the airline's fleet.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/64e4f7aa-5dc8-4d84-8645-7460e98d8e5f/thumbnail/770x578/f46c9849aaa44d30b7d813cab37520cf/the-chicken.jpg
Each of the nine simulators has a rubber chicken hanging from it somewhere. Though not an airline industry standard, at Southwest, the practice is thought to bring pilots good luck.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/22598e81-2d8e-4f3e-b967-9d0a26b812d3/thumbnail/770x578/c0652d579d198e7ab5b06706de508569/dt-in-the-flight-simulator.jpg

In the lobby of Southwest's main headquarters building, a set of scale-model Boeing 737s hangs from the ceiling, each representing a livery the airline is currently flying.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/a0bf9caf-5a09-4745-94f4-8291776d7384/thumbnail/770x578/18015fc74705d584172eebcb05fb6dae/nose-photo-op.jpg
Scattered around the airline's headquarters are a set of "photo ops," like this one, where employees and visitors are invited to stop and pose for a photograph.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/45a1b20e-6dcf-441e-9d31-4547a0bdf335/thumbnail/770x578/593f38b24c9e3c7d1fa58ca0396c96a0/working-on-the-bridge.jpg
One of Southwest's big new initiatives is this giant center, the NOC, or network operations center. Here, representatives from most of the airline's departments work in small teams to dispatch and monitor each and every one of its daily flights. Here, we see supervisors monitoring flights on the "bridge," the raised area in the middle of the center where senior members of the teams sit and work.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/ea9aa7ad-0edc-4fc4-8387-d5ba08a7fc64/thumbnail/770x578/3da0c0b876f497d354876849c7133610/noc-wide.jpg
A look at the NOC from the rear of the room. Southwest built the center with plenty of room to expand.

A dispatcher's computer screen shows that the intended route for a Baltimore to Salt Lake City flight would take it through a giant set of thunderstorms. His challenge is to find an efficient route around the 55,000-foot-tall thunderheads.

Southwest recently opened a giant new facility across the street from its main headquarters. Known as TOPS, or Training and Operations, the building is home to the airline's entire training program, which used to be distributed around the country. This large scale-model Boeing 737 hangs in the TOPS lobby.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/3b350930-217c-416b-9372-81c33c5e4b63/thumbnail/770x578/16db8b6f0ea1d30aa46fbef3caa13da9/listening-center-word-cloud.jpg
Recently, Southwest opened what it calls its "Listening Center." Designed to help its communications department monitor social-media channels throughout the day, the idea is that it can react to many types of customer complaints or questions, or to unfolding events much faster than using traditional methods.One way it does so is by looking to see what the most common phrases being used in conjunction with the airline's name are at any time. The result is this word cloud.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/17/f3acbbda-b5d2-4da6-9c50-b556ec7ee261/thumbnail/770x578/fbc7468e4d32dfc22b097a5678cd95a9/listening-center.jpg

It may look just like an airport's Southwest Airlines check-in counter, but in fact this is a mock-up of one in the airline's training center.

[Date]2014-06-21                 Making the world's most efficient locomotive 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/18/28850589-4455-4574-b881-e3466a0780bb/thumbnail/770x578/4f66eaa499fea65254616524631caee9/locomotive-in-the-paint-shop.jpg
Here, a locomotive is inside the paint shop. Currently, all locomotives made
in the Fort Worth factory are being sold to BNSF Railway, so this machine will soon
sport the orange and black livery of BNSF.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/18/0fafdd36-73e8-46e4-a4b8-2fd8ed81a898/thumbnail/770x578/4ff4a570171bb7e200882003e80a7b1d/operator-and-auxiliary-cab-on-platform.jpg
A completed locomotive weighs in at 440,000 pounds, and the platform it's built on alone weighs 120,000 pounds.Here,
GE staffers work to assemble a locomotive. The platform has been
mounted on the trucks (wheels) and they've added the operator cab and
the auxiliary cab -- the section where all the electronics are
installed.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/18/0db0b3f6-1048-44f5-9569-d5f4a31389d0/thumbnail/770x578/e740ebcd205dc51e0c42980693a5ffdf/engines.jpg
Two giant diesel engines sit on the floor in the Fort Worth assembly facility, ready to be being built into locomotives. The engines are built in Grove City, Pa., and weigh 34,000 pounds. A train pulled by a couple of locomotives can haul a ton of freight 500 miles on a single gallon of fuel.

Robot Carrier
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/23/d1851e63-13eb-4951-a476-51683167cf8e/thumbnail/770x578/05e3359c1b069108e36b2bde8e28edac/smss-on-dirt.jpg
Lockheed's SMSS was designed to be able to navigate nearly any kind of terrain. One example is dirt. The vehicles can be remote controlled from nearby, can be be programmed to run autonomously, or can be controlled from hundreds of miles away by satellite.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/23/847839f9-b13d-4fb2-aadd-378abc4ef0ef/thumbnail/770x578/995b81fcebab2ca3b277f0e3e0270654/smss-climbing-rocks.jpg
At Lockheed's robotics facility in Grand Prairie, Tex., near Dallas, the SMSS easily climbs over a pile of rocks, demonstrating its prowess on multiple types of terrain.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/23/1e54c0b3-f3d2-478f-8db7-ae1116cc0346/thumbnail/770x578/983b1ec154a1cf2f602e2be540dcc290/smss-cied-down-wadi.jpg
Although the military hasn't issued a contract for an autonomous ground vehicle like the SMSS, it's clear that among many things that will be required if, and when, it does, will be the ability for the vehicles to rake the ground for potential land mines or other explosives. Though the machines may be destroyed or damaged by such weapons, no soldiers or Marines would be harmed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/23/42a17197-7571-4a77-adae-dcc7d28c310b/thumbnail/770x578/8632c7320bd67db63209254361e66f20/following-while-walking.jpg
Another capability Lockheed has built into the SMSS is for the vehicle to autonomously follow an individual. Once set to do so, it can distinguish between multiple people, and will continue to follow the person it's supposed to. Here, an SMSS drives a short distance behind a Lockheed employee as he walks across a field at the company's robotics facility in Grand Prairie, Tex.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/23/106d9a90-1d76-4fd6-9203-93723cf67b07/thumbnail/770x578/0d7ffe7280ee82a7286d176645bae9b9/following-while-running.jpg
The SMSS has no problem keeping up with the person it's supposed to be following when he's running.

At Lockheed's robotics facility, it has three SMSS', including this one, painted in camouflage.
 
 
 
 
[Date]2014-06-26    How the Navy trains its pilots 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/2c7db9d9-cedc-447b-9650-f0944ce0be85/thumbnail/770x578/5e1edfda2a824dbff98d40fc35f7cf68/banking-left.jpg
How the Navy trains its pilots 
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/8d7e52c6-acfe-43d7-bd8f-87cbc664f402/thumbnail/770x578/044189fae6766a8610a8423b2786144f/cockpit.jpg
The "cockpit" of the T-6B simulator is just like its real-world counterpart, so pilots learn how to use all the instruments, switches, and other elements of the plane in the simulator as part of their training on the aircraft.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/4d6ff0f5-41b6-4d04-a3ba-7570e3abe20d/thumbnail/770x578/fd7d36915bb3de26bdb1ed031ce91bde/3-t-6-simulator-pods.jpg
Each of these giant black pods houses a T-6B simulator, and the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi has six of them, all grouped together inside a large training hangar near other T-6B and T-34 simulators.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/8a0bd4fe-a82f-4481-9c0c-02381341d43a/thumbnail/770x578/44524f3157d81aedcc84db2fc330ba7d/daniel-flying.jpg
CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman banks left, "flying" over Corpus Christi in the T-6B simulator.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/f8e38477-7f68-4600-a06b-0806443c50f4/thumbnail/770x578/065d6c29771b6c7ef514125a91e39b33/main-t-6-simulator.jpg
The T-6B simulator, moments before "takeoff."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/f8d14c95-801d-41ba-8c7a-01dc72e28d00/thumbnail/770x578/5e1a27a609d46fd3cd5eeced49531805/t-6-simulator-weather-control-screen.jpg
Simulator instructors can control many factors about the conditions pilot trainees will be "flying" in, including choosing a wide variety of weather conditions. This is the screen that allows instructors to pick the conditions they want.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/7aba1c85-31cb-470f-9983-2abf6ec9a768/thumbnail/770x578/dd529f09a1ba69bd09919bd1ef575142/simulator-server.jpg
The simulator is run on this server, located alongside it.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/0e742734-a929-4728-a50b-e36d63860a0d/thumbnail/770x578/05fa09531508c4ad30af08280a578c51/dc-10-soars-overhead.jpg
Another element the instructor can throw at a pilot trainee is another airplane flying near its airspace, like this DC-10.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/35b89ac6-96e5-401a-8e9a-b7d2507412a4/thumbnail/770x578/0ad6dfcb74e61cb202718c51215b326e/t-6s.jpg
Parked on the tarmac at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi are T-6Bs, the Navy's newest basic training airplane. It is replacing the T-34, which the Navy has been using for many years.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/d1f2da11-9654-4039-9d4f-07469d006551/thumbnail/770x578/1525675f5ce504af381eedbe98e21234/t-34.jpg
Although the Navy is still teaching pilots to fly in Corpus Christi using the T-34, the planes are soon going to be completely phased out.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/368ce858-3898-4cee-b648-f047cacc32ff/thumbnail/770x578/620d51658db50db9fd0ccf41d5b23e4b/super-king-air.jpg
Pilots who have graduated from their initial training choose a specialty. Those who choose multiple engine planes can fly the Super King Air (seen here) at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/594c12a8-188d-4788-b7bc-0d348ff126c8/thumbnail/770x578/30c935b1fc1e6b1cd1dd769ba2a3479e/t-44s.jpg
Another advanced aircraft pilots can fly after their initial training is the T-44, seen here.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/e4a52ccd-9598-47bb-b204-1e31106a17da/thumbnail/770x578/f9346baae2c066000a595e2108a800c8/many-t-6s.jpg
There are about 60 T-6Bs being used for training -- not all at once -- at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/88cff74f-11fc-4ba5-8c3f-e7f936887afa/thumbnail/770x578/9bc84b48b16eba21b4ff0eaa8aa06a03/t-34s.jpg
There are still plenty of T-34s being used at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, although the planes will soon be phased out entirely.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/e71eaecc-f5c8-416f-b1bb-815a278c3537/thumbnail/770x578/a765b6d2e3a9c6a7eb5a3cff457662e5/t-6-simulator-without-screen-graphics.jpg
Before pilots get into the full T-6B simulator, they first "fly" in this, a similar trainer -- except that it doesn't display graphics on the three screens on the dashboard.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/a8e785b8-d647-420d-a7a0-16e682ab1341/thumbnail/770x578/28e504c1d152a1511b6ffd8c8dfe4034/steam-gauges.jpg
Pilots call the old-fashioned dials found on the T-34, and in the T-34 simulator "steam gauges."
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/1f7b5a7a-252f-41bd-9f22-08cc482af686/thumbnail/770x578/0d3b018bac0cec7af7c0e08268afa4ea/t-34-simulator.jpg
A look at a T-34 simulator from the side.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/25/8c581061-81ef-47da-a7b8-9a567601da71/thumbnail/770x578/ecd001541ef59e02128096903007c0dc/t-34-trainer-with-trampoline.jpg
On the T-34, pilots who needed to eject hit an ejection switch and then had to somersault out. In this simulator, a trampoline is set up alongside to allow the pilot to do so.

Tracking smuggling
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/77d832aa-94b4-4133-bdfa-99b4f3d3d643/thumbnail/770x578/d4b9b81de046493599d80251f265a577/slick-off-to-the-right.jpg
As part of a training exercise, this P-3 Orion Long Range Tracker (LRT) located and tracked a Cessna that was playing the role of a smuggler's plane flying over the Gulf of Mexico south of Corpus Christi. Then, to demonstrate its ability to sneak up on other planes, the aircraft, known as a "Slick," flew behind the P-3 Orion that CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman was in.At first invisible -- it was below us and just to the left -- it then came up alongside and posed for this photo.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/77164d46-7929-49c2-9a90-70b066dcdc0b/thumbnail/770x578/2d69e0ecedb448e9b16bf3c344a4823d/manning-three-radar-screens.jpg
Three CBP agents, including Senior Detection Enforcement Officer (Airborne) Tom Mason, in the foreground, monitor radar screens aboard the P-3 Orion while in flight over the Gulf of Mexico. The three were overseeing the exercise, watching the other two planes on their radar screens.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/6bb3c3dc-dfed-47da-99e0-1178d72b64ed/thumbnail/770x578/35dda192974896a8a34d26b0e2d58e41/radar-map.jpg
Mason's screen displays what the P-3's APS-145 radar was detecting in and around the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the contacts on the screen are boats of one kind or another.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/31f683ea-b095-4ff1-b774-4363e49c3a56/thumbnail/770x578/044410b09b677e0630a14d57554f44d2/nose-cone-apg-66.jpg
Found inside the nose cone of the P-3 LRT, this APG-66 air-to-air radar allows the Slick to lock on to target planes, letting agents on board the LRT decide whether the target is worth spending time following and investigating.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/9c3b5602-5459-44a8-895e-fbbc8a1dba93/thumbnail/770x578/0ecddd8ea68bb005e1a6aeb71163432f/nose-cone-seavue.jpg
This is a SeaVue surveillance radar system, mounted below the Slick. A surface-search radar system, it can identify a trash can in water from 50 miles away.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/7d77293f-30bb-44fa-b073-5b005ff61453/thumbnail/770x578/dc11568558d49d8a53f41dff5bdd44ca/nose-cone-westcam.jpg
Mounted inside the nose cone of the P-3 LRT is this Wescam MX-20 optical system, which generates imagery that shows up in the signal coming in from the APG-66.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/0a667e30-965d-49e6-a110-cf5b2b4d2fc6/thumbnail/770x578/e3add852033d57cccb1460fb686f0a5e/radar-overlay-on-navigation-map.jpg
CBP agents like Tom Mason have many tools at their disposal as they work to interdict smugglers. One is the ability to overlay the radar information with a navigation map, allowing them to see precisely where a target is.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/2eacb1ed-9d30-4808-b7ce-a233caff03db/thumbnail/770x578/63ffc88ac92bf1e30901a1c403b3309c/mason-manning-the-radar.jpg
Mason monitors his screen to see the location of the P-3 LRT and the Cessna, as the two planes practice playing a cat-and-mouse game over the Gulf of Mexico.

A Customs and Border Protection MQ-9 Guardian inside the agency's Corpus Christi hangar. The drone can fly up to 30,000 feet for 20 hours and monitor the border and other areas for illicit activity. The Guardian is essentially a Predator that's outfitted with additional radar and optics packages, such as the SeaVue.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/26/ed3b8522-1bf3-4627-95f0-e32d418b88df/thumbnail/770x578/010c0c0fce6efbc61db1a01031e6bc1d/guardian-camera-mount.jpg
A Wescam MX-20 optics package is mounted underneath the Guardian. The mount includes various cameras and lasers used to identify and watch targets from as high as 30,000 feet.

[Date]2014-06-30      How the Air Force hardens planes against signal leakage 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/d4ef7f8c-d652-4a76-b6f8-870f670e789d/thumbnail/770x578/1f1a1e0027fbb8ecf32e7f6cda537fc9/c-5-nose-up-with-van.jpg
Working out of a special white RV parked alongside a C-5 -- the Air Force's largest airplane -- technicians demonstrated how they test for leaked signals.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/7fc406c4-ed89-431a-9f20-b6d43e2857fa/thumbnail/770x578/ab826f366bc51742f225fbb089d1c125/c-5-nose-up.jpg
The Lockheed C-5 Galaxy is the Air Force's largest airplane, a cargo plane capable of being refueled in mid-air. Cargo can be loaded from either the front, or the rear.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/d569e90f-4d40-4543-8c65-85fbc65450c2/thumbnail/770x578/192fca2c37899f929fd5642c674a026e/c-5.jpg
The C-5, manufactured by Lockheed since 1968, has to be "re-glassed," or revamped, after years of service. When that happens, the 24th Air Force has to make sure all its new or reconfigured communications systems are hardened against unintentional leakage.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/64caf1ab-4273-4980-ba96-6b2290d22342/thumbnail/770x578/5bd5469761a29216316f4b4dad813932/van-and-the-c-5.jpg
The special RV used to monitor communications emissions from Air Force aircraft. The RV can be flown around the world, as the Air Force works to test every aircraft the service flies.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/9617084b-155a-4b8d-9228-4cd9c35ec392/thumbnail/770x578/0c8cc23efaebd3350eb8f605a79ffac2/the-e.jpg
As a demonstration, a laptop aboard the C-5 was set up with this "E" on its screen. The idea was to see if the monitors in the RV could "see" the signal.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/586d8f25-4dca-48b1-8840-26cbdeeac131/thumbnail/770x578/cf4e3694b416d47a0d033a648ba2132e/antenna-and-computer.jpg
A special antenna was set up alongside the laptop, in order to see whether the signal from the computer could be read in the nearby RV.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/e37683f3-0b79-40df-96c0-609dc4a08222/thumbnail/770x578/e643c35e6df5a86e98d3ea15090db60b/ghost-of-the-e.jpg
In the RV, a technician caught an image of the "E," appearing almost ghost-like in a sea of electronic noise. The point was made: the laptop on the plane was not secure enough to be used without stricter security measures.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/27/edb50ac4-22f1-487a-b6e2-540b29217bb4/thumbnail/770x578/389d0c4bb566704f3d220bfb34fdb7fa/monitoring.jpg
Two Air Force technicians in the RV monitor the signal coming from the laptop on board the C-5.

The double-decker C-5 is 247 feet long, and its upper deck, behind the flight deck, is longer than some other entire airplanes.

[Date]2014-07-01     In Austin, Prof. Dumpster lives the good life 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/09766182-f9bd-4acb-9c97-1b0958620f0f/thumbnail/770x578/07f12d78321543f88ef9ff35a93e473f/exodus.jpg
Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.For a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living.
 
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/1d18a681-52c0-4f9f-8db5-1512b7716e8a/thumbnail/770x578/5e976186c82f34f055d9aaa0a0ac05fb/dumpster-axon-phase-3.png
Currently, the Dumpster Project is in Phase I, and Professor Dumpster and his team are actively trying to raise money to proceed to the next stages of the initiative.This document shows what the project is intended to look like when it's much further along. With multiple stories, and a developed garden, this dumpster could be sophisticated living for the minimalist-inclined.
 
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/d62cb2e4-d8d0-401d-a55f-5d034dd3ad75/thumbnail/770x578/aa4a7764fbd0821608a376453abdbb24/prof-dumpster-laughing.jpg
Standing inside the dumpster, located at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, laughs and enjoys his 33-square-foot home.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/ac59132c-413d-4fe3-bc9f-71ed94a6313f/thumbnail/770x578/9eb7bce14ce4c7c1fc7dbe6f498afe6a/pushing-water-tank.jpg
In its current state, the dumpster isn't connected to the grid in any way, which means that Professor Dumpster must get water the old-fashioned way -- by carrying it home. When he needs water, he pushes this water barrel, which holds 24 gallons, to Austin's Lady Bird Lake, an hour round-trip, where he fills it up. When he returns, he filters the water in order to make it potable.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/f3f60272-e7aa-4a0b-8d30-f598b4990102/thumbnail/770x578/656d90cbaceed329071378065b26cec4/on-the-phone.jpg
Though the dumpster isn't connected to the grid, that doesn't mean Professor Dumpster is cut off from the world. He uses his iPhone to talk to people, and he spends much of the daylight hours at his university office, which is only a couple hundred yards away.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/69c76f73-05fc-43f9-96fc-c737d5bd5cb1/thumbnail/770x578/06550991c0b269586a2a40abbf2f58dc/second-layer-in-hidden-compartment.jpg
At first glance, you can't tell where Professor Dumpster keeps any of his clothes, bedding, or other important supplies. Then he opens a lid, revealing several hidden compartments under the floor.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/2bfe74b4-3511-45dc-a498-2a456cfc5241/thumbnail/770x578/5f0f1fca2e2702261962ea6fe2068f65/garden.jpg
One element of the Dumpster Project is to grow a sustainable garden alongside the dumpster. Tended by Professor Dumpster and his students, the garden is turning out several kinds of vegetables.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/0509582d-b25b-42c8-b5e8-c0c6f6fc2f6f/thumbnail/770x578/de34dcf3eae8f32fffebd1c7cada4fc0/dumpster-axon-2.png
As a way of demonstrating how much less energy and water he can live on than is used by the average American household, Professor Dumpster plans on installing a set of the average collection of household appliances next to the dumpster that he will use for a few months to establish an energy/water/waste consumption baseline. Then he will be able to compare his own usage to that of the baseline.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/8a8c53fe-bf32-4b6d-b34e-4909ecfbd1e6/thumbnail/770x578/950ca7fc63e539e13bacd44b1997c9db/its-bigger-on-the-inside.jpg
As an homage to Dr. Who and the Tardis, Professor Dumpster has a welcome mat outside the dumpster that reads "It's bigger on the inside."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/ac469707-3daa-4de5-8f3e-56af8bcd3e0e/thumbnail/770x578/d7f12121ec4b1aaa62228f4230f77259/couchsurfing-note.jpg
Professor Dumpster has not been the only one to live in the dumpster. Because it is a demonstration project, many others -- including his students -- have spent nights there. But he also opened up the dumpster to users of Couchsurfing.com, prompting this note from the first person to ever use that Web-based service to find a bed in a dumpster.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/90f650e0-abeb-425d-90b1-73b439541cb3/thumbnail/770x578/c8f3fb5f035f28af086bbcc5777704da/laying-out-bedpad.jpg
Because the dumpster's interior space is so small, Professor Dumpster must keep his bedding hidden away until he needs it. Here, he begins to set up the bed, first laying out his sleeping pad.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/eb2435a0-ed38-4a7a-a1b6-f09ae132f8c7/thumbnail/770x578/35d587b59ce43c7ec228ea1723fda6d2/star-wars-sheets.jpg
Befitting a geek like Professor Dumpster, he makes his bed using "original" "Star Wars" sheets.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/02725d24-d665-4263-82ee-f77b70fc06e5/thumbnail/770x578/1f90df0309fe2ae0cdde8797a1b2d1a2/mosquito-net.jpg
To attach a mosquito net, Professor Dumpster uses magnets that attach to the metal walls of the dumpster. He also uses magnets to attach many other things to the walls, including drawings by his daughter and other children.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/a775603e-03b0-48c5-b867-942bb2b75fd8/thumbnail/770x578/aab9e90b6f1cdb41c6f66e0c365bce5e/climbing-in.jpg
Professor Dumpster climbs inside his home.

The top of the dumpster opens and closes, and when it rains, Professor Dumpster closes it. Here, he looks in on his small home from above.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/06/30/8ba9133f-2d96-43ca-b873-90351d09b2b8/thumbnail/770x578/c982a9e75240ef34ae44ce00aaee5531/making-coffee-on-the-patio.jpg
Professor Dumpster calls himself a cross between Bill Nye the Science Guy and Oscar the Grouch.&nbsp; Here, he makes a cup of Turkish Coffee on the bench outside the dumpster while wearing his Oscar the Grouch cap.

When he needs to get around, he tries to use pedal power -- meaning he rides this three-wheeled bike as much as he can.

This mailbox on the outside of the&nbsp; dumpster is one sign someone lives inside.

The official timeline of the Dumpster Project. On Monday, the project canceled its Kickstarter due to insufficient funding. They had been seeking $100,000, but received less than $16,000.The project is planned out well into next year, including a wide range of expansion and educational initiatives. Professor Dumpster is now hoping people will donate funds directly through its Web site.
 
 
 
 
 
[Date]2014-07-03     Into the wild blue yonder: US Air Force basic training 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/e3ca32a0-bfac-4739-ab66-dd597099bd0f/thumbnail/770x578/c3662a21878416dd82bee52227cd9b85/new-trainees-putting-on-new-shoes.jpg
Survive training
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/47822496-1621-485b-ae5c-c3c58c05d738/thumbnail/770x578/201982820c21c94c4122539cd46e826f/graduation-girlfriends-congratulates.jpg
After eight weeks of basic training, the trainees become airmen, and their graduation is celebrated by a large contingent of family and friends. Here, a new airman gets a warm welcome from a friend.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/f34a29a3-167d-4157-8fe1-2f93c89091db/thumbnail/770x578/12814490a6307d9747b175e04c0576f1/new-trainees-line-up-first-thing.jpg
New trainees are broken up into squadrons, and then into groups, known as "flights." Here, a flight of fresh trainees waits outside to be brought in, have their heads shaved, and get all their new gear.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/84bb626f-3bb6-4664-90ee-dc88ef4de22a/thumbnail/770x578/73393d6672a59ae43b546574be198404/new-trainees-ready-to-go-in.jpg
A flight lines up outside the building where they will get their heads shaved and be given their gear. Though they've barely begun their training, they're already required to stand at attention, be silent, and look straight ahead.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/b31891d4-28cf-4917-b2ed-1cf52a420567/thumbnail/770x578/5c43c1707584b5de310d76391fe374e6/new-trainees-with-duffels.jpg
Preparing to go inside the building, the new trainees hold their brand-new duffel bags, which will soon be filled with 40 to 45 pounds of gear.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/9f39e11d-5544-4d81-9894-872ad81fb2cb/thumbnail/770x578/73203736485ad78a81422f9d99fe524c/new-trainee-full-hair.jpg
They may come in with short hair or long hair, but if they're male, it's got to go. Here, a new trainee prepares to say goodbye to his full head of hair.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/2842e78f-ddd4-4b1c-8a7b-d361567c37ac/thumbnail/770x578/b2a1f05ab8213452c583baafae115715/new-trainee-shaved-head.jpg
It took less than two minutes for this trainee, seen in the previous photo with a full head of hair, to have his head shaved. Now he's ready to begin his Air Force training.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/93e75a62-7f32-4459-bfcd-8ecac1d65be5/thumbnail/770x578/ee0097d532d17f4e77b4b48576f3fccb/new-trainee-head-shaving.jpg
For 53 years, Lester West has shaved incoming male trainees' heads. Over that time, he said, he's probably shaved more than a million heads.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/762bb7d6-398e-411d-89df-a43694df51f9/thumbnail/770x578/92fb09db8c30e68645fee654862b3b2d/new-trainee-body-scan-stepping-in.jpg
The Air Force is using a body scanner to determine each trainee's measurements. Here, a trainee is seen stepping into the body scanner.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/d5afea3e-0128-4821-b7db-4f81747c21b5/thumbnail/770x578/0d58fe4bb68b75cd888faa0d4104a3f5/new-trainee-body-scan-standing-still.jpg
A trainee stands still as the body scanner determines his measurements.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/fbeeb782-5640-480e-ac1c-eefd1cb5e14b/thumbnail/770x578/3ee68dc7d40f16d6e78278acdc2f4dc1/new-trainee-going-through-rfid-scanner.jpg
Each and every piece of gear the trainees are given has an embedded RFID tag. When they have suited up and have everything else in their duffel or in their hands, they walk through this scanner, which is meant to determine if they have everything they need.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/8757eda8-a85d-4f8e-a78a-7e1915e702b2/thumbnail/770x578/ce5ea49bc65277feffc0091bffcdf60e/new-trainee-ready-to-check-out.jpg
A brand-new trainee, boots in hand and hat on head, prepares to check out. His eight-week journey to becoming an Air Force airman has begun.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/b5888733-ad22-4374-9e2a-2f8085b4a294/thumbnail/770x578/9e3bbdf0891a536ce10b2e9fd135a959/following-rules.jpg
These rules are posted on the wall for trainees to read and follow as they wait for processing. It's clear, from the last rule in the list, that this sign has been posted since a sexual harassment/assault scandal rocked the Air Force a few years ago. Many of the new procedures in place at Lackland have been instituted in response to the scandal, in which dozens of female trainees said they were sexually assaulted by instructors.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/e7d18d61-3604-4be1-b1b5-316a0fb752d2/thumbnail/770x578/f1143c1a824eb88df542b818c48305d5/training-beds-and-lockers.jpg
In a brand-new dormitory building, trainees' beds and lockers are perfectly made and organized during the day while they go through training exercises.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/fc5a18f2-e0fa-405a-8d1b-736e6f6a3ef2/thumbnail/770x578/bbc49895b2971f8303fc95e772622726/training-rifles.jpg
Trainees learn to work with these rifles, which cannot fire live rounds, but which will be used in all weapon drills during their time at Lackland.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/5ce8b47f-98b2-4e44-bd3f-5b606ba7313a/thumbnail/770x578/b75a5c1c335bcbda843414f92bc796b5/training-firing-positions.jpg
Trainees do a wide range of drills during their time at Lackland Air Force Base, including learning how to work from a firing position like this one. Unfortunately, no live training was going on when CNET Road Trip visited.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/7f1b7c1a-7b03-473b-bd85-b1f314f34264/thumbnail/770x578/6c934e92f354277cb465a06d7bae7333/training-computers.jpg
Trainees spend several hours every day in classrooms, learning the academic portion of their Air Force education. Classrooms are filled with non-networked computers. They are not allowed normal outside contact during their eight weeks of training, though they are allowed a few short phone calls to friends or family. They may not access any kind of social media during the training period.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/62ef442e-8828-4ace-a641-44253d5fe743/thumbnail/770x578/68da511cdd53d7845723945598d5fba2/training-tracks.jpg
The trainees go through regular physical exercise, including running around a large track near their barracks. Based on the speed of previous runs, they are categorized into groups, each of which has a specific color. The slowest runners use the red lane, while the fastest use the blue lane. This is meant to apply peer pressure to get better as they proceed through training.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/f9805d1c-c7c1-49cc-ae3c-254c0bbdee91/thumbnail/770x578/34f982693f50c5adbda88c41319b2f02/here-they-come.jpg
After eight weeks, the trainees graduate. But a day before the formal graduation ceremony, they take part in what is known as the "airman's run," where each of the flights dresses in special shirts and runs over this bridge and through a gantlet of their friends and family members.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/3bda4ee3-cbce-40e2-b290-9258bfd7e519/thumbnail/770x578/cf5032a76c8d9ec1b3022e351b903542/airmens-run.jpg
Carrying a group of flags, graduating airmen continue the Airman's run.

The day before they officially graduate, the new airmen go through what is known as the Coin Ceremony, where they are given the ceremonial coin that signifies their entrance into the Air Force. Here, a flight arrives at the ceremony as hundreds of friends and family, as well as the airmen's instructors look on.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/2ece3b30-5549-469e-96f3-4b218836d5d5/thumbnail/770x578/0f25753667b46e174922f12e04e3de84/edmondson-congratulating-top-airman.jpg
Col. Michele Edmondson, the commander of Air Force basic training, congratulates the top airman, as measured by a wide range of criteria, during the coin ceremony.

NASA Training
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/e218e15d-227d-44b5-860e-2c025ba4ab98/thumbnail/770x578/b1907bbdffdbb85461020a8f5f23d1c5/pants-laid-out.jpg
Most weekdays, NASA puts two of its astronauts through training sessions at the NBL, where they'll spend six hours underwater, each working with rotating teams of safety-, camera-, and support-divers.Before the astronauts come out to suit up, though, support teams lay out their suits in preparation.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/f22d586a-bc2d-465e-a26d-2889f49bf540/thumbnail/770x578/ca03fbb52a1f09c5493555cefb764ec1/all-the-camera-views.jpg
In a control room above the NBL pool, technicians monitor up to 21 different camera views of the astronauts' work on the ISS mock-up from in and around the pool.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/e645ae18-5d34-4563-843f-3221766eec5f/thumbnail/770x578/a9adcb42782e1a6ec8f7f6843df908af/kelly-gloves-helmet-laid-out.jpg
Mark and Scott Kelly are part of a NASA experiment to see how space affects both members of a set of twins.When CNET visited, Scott Kelly was slated to be working in the NBL pool. Here, his gloves and helmet are seen laid out and awaiting his arrival to suit up.

Kelly now has on his helmet. It's almost time to be lowered into the water for his six-hour NBL session.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/02/fc6a7c86-c6c8-4f72-924e-8997490c2d21/thumbnail/770x578/c63bf0bcc1740159efe485919273612f/astronaut.jpg

Elvis home

If you've never been to Graceland, you might think that Elvis' famous mansion is huge.But while it's by no means a small house, it's also manageable and stately. Seen here is the front of the mansion.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/46ab7496-53c9-4a4e-83a7-5c6a04ca121c/thumbnail/770x578/ee9d06cc4d25749dd2695062c6973637/music-room.jpg
A look into Elvis' living room, near the front entrance of Graceland. Elvis would hold court in the room and play music on the piano in the far room in the rear of the picture.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/829e5554-e132-4f31-85fc-6567150aa036/thumbnail/770x578/1f0c551286e5693f0d13d1d62fb908ed/kitchen-1.jpg
Nothing special by today's standards, the Graceland kitchen was surely luxurious when Elvis moved into the 1939 house in 1957.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/191235a8-e354-48e8-b68d-070931c3b4ce/thumbnail/770x578/82c28ab573e0f3a51697fc2376de8207/kitchen-2.jpg

The Mercedes-Benz E250 Bluetec that CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman has been road-testing on Road Trip 2014, seen parked just outside the main gates to Graceland.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/84ed45a8-c0bc-491e-8127-60c07c98ab12/thumbnail/770x578/02567061cd960ef9e23c3f9f3301e599/tv-lounge.jpg
Elvis' TV lounge, where the rock and roll star liked to watch TV with friends.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/4dcc143d-5368-4962-8625-97e9bf123876/thumbnail/770x578/59d74c9911f3573471a82562fa9a0519/tv-lounge-bar.jpg
What TV lounge would be complete without a matching bar?
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/6b7a9df2-f52c-41e1-8f8f-690c3ec2f347/thumbnail/770x578/5306fab7adb6a4e62a0c30b886b2be28/billiards-room.jpg
Graceland features many different design motifs, with no consistent style from room to room. This is the billiards room, which has a style unlike anything else in the famous mansion. Elvis decorated the room himself in 1974, according to Threads, and he used more than 300 yards of fabric to do so.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/e41bb03d-acf0-48f5-9d3e-38f8218128f2/thumbnail/770x578/de636faf60a4aacc3b3f3d565ba10966/jungle-room.jpg
Elvis' famous jungle room. According to Elvis.com, "the Jungle Room has become famous over the years due to the eccentric design with a Polynesian influence, reminiscent of Elvis' favorite vacation spot -- Hawaii. The detailed wooden carvings in the furniture and the green shag carpet of the 1970s makes this an Elvis fan favorite."
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/b3879536-edc1-4a3a-b71a-262703f1b921/thumbnail/770x578/2a6fd452ab9756aa4bd0a8f62ac29198/lisa-marie-swing-set.jpg
Behind the main house on the 13.8-acre Graceland estate is this small cottage, where Elvis' father, Vernon Presley, managed the star's business affairs. Placed in front of the cottage is this swing set, which Elvis bought for his daughter, Lisa Marie, in the 1970s.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/de372833-fece-457c-807a-e90a33ae5928/thumbnail/770x578/43f00a430e24c438c388d3e0c0fa9ab4/hall-of-gold.jpg
Elvis had more than 150 hit records during his career, many of which earned him gold and platinum records from RCA, his label, and the Recording Industry Association of America.Many of those gold and platinum records, along with plenty of other memorabilia from his career, is housed in this room, known as the Hall of Gold.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/e3c29e44-9d18-4267-a71c-7d401ab31849/thumbnail/770x578/49cad7efea881a9fc59ad8c0e2257f51/dont-be-cruel-five-gold-records.jpg
This is a commemoration of Elvis' song "Don't Be Cruel" having sold five million copies.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/f2479def-5619-4fb3-8ee9-d01d7c5a85e3/thumbnail/770x578/2371c6d658548c2855c0e52ff4c90157/so-many-gold-records.jpg
A walk down through the Hall of Gold makes you realize just how successful an entertainer Elvis was, at least as measured by awards and sales.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/d6080609-1958-4fee-9a5a-766dfe035af5/thumbnail/770x578/910899fb10cf5ce46cd69b991d2fb2b4/hall-of-gold-records-on-wall.jpg
Another look at the nearly endless collection of gold and platinum records Elvis earned in his short career. He died at Graceland when he was only 42.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/205c3a15-754d-443d-bbd7-f4852b34016c/thumbnail/770x578/55421f1baa0f5b603acd411c2926fd11/elvis-suits.jpg
In addition to housing many of his gold and platinum records and other awards and commemorations, the former racquetball court also houses a number of the outlandish suits Elvis wore when he performed in Las Vegas.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/8a9a6f2b-f07d-4b5c-a6ff-f5c2790a11f8/thumbnail/770x578/be973b7453c324af37d20ea87067353c/meditation-garden.jpg
Graceland visitors' last tour stop is the Meditation Garden, which is a place to pause and quietly contemplate the life of one of the biggest stars in American history. Elvis, along with his parents, his grandmother, and his twin brother -- who died at birth -- are all buried here.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/d5690144-a7e8-44f3-b938-920a3513abaf/thumbnail/770x578/80392d2ccbf694c283d7f1e07810b4ba/rolls-royces.jpg
Many Graceland visitors also check out the associated museum housing many of Elvis' cars and other vehicles.These are two Rolls-Royce Silver Clouds. The white one is a 1966 model, which he eventually traded in.The black one is a 1960 Silver Cloud, which was Elvis' first Rolls, though he owned several during his life.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/a678b147-bcc9-4999-adbb-5f01f4a2f053/thumbnail/770x578/ddd852425c80e2f47a9d7688c54213ca/ferrari.jpg
This is a 1975 Ferrari Dino, which Elvis bought used in 1976 for $20,583.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/c7368053-dff4-470f-b94e-be2fa7a0e411/thumbnail/770x578/9875b4a8fa931d2cf2fad45057790c33/lincoln-continental.jpg
This is Elvis' 1956 Lincoln Continental Mark II. It was a rare car that cost $10,000 when new, far more than the $4,000 average price of a Cadillac. According to Graceland, Elvis bought this Lincoln after his first one was covered in lipstick graffiti left by fans.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/08/ade06500-b90c-4c24-ba91-44219f37c618/thumbnail/770x578/391f2a652cad96cbc908443a735797b0/stutz.jpg
Elvis was driving this 1973 Stutz Blackhawk, one of his favorite cars, when he drove through the gates of Graceland for the final time, on August 16, 1977.

According to Graceland, this may be the most famous of Elvis' cars, a pink 1955 Cadillac Fleetwood. He first used it to tour, but then gave it to his mother, who loved it. It became known as "Gladys' car."

Originally flown by Delta Airlines, this was a 96-seater Convair 880 built in 1956. Elvis purchased it in 1975 for $250,000, and he spent an additional $800,000 customizing it.Elvis flew on the plane 221 times and named it Lisa Marie, after his daughter.

Elvis' other airplane was this 10-seater Lockheed JetStar, built in 1960. He purchased it in 1975 for just under $900,000 and nicknamed it the "Hound Dog II."Elvis' support staff used the plane to fly ahead when he was on tour, to make sure all the arrangements were in order for his arrival.
 
 
 
 
 
[Date]2014-07-11    Why FedEx beats up packages in a lab 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/63d867ac-950c-43eb-8c1d-c33574382a67/thumbnail/770x578/eacf21a541d49bd842ab01b4a96bbcfd/compression-machine-in-action.jpg
Here, we see an engineer inspecting how a package is performing while being compressed with more than 50 pounds of pressure.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/f1b5eed2-b50d-4666-9c81-3dfb519bb5eb/thumbnail/770x578/1e82d8923c87cc413a431efc5d257a77/drop-machine-1.jpg
A technician prepares to drop a package using a machine that lifts it up and then slams it down to the floor. The idea is to test each and every side and edge of the package. Boxes aimed at the domestic market will be dropped 10 times, while those that go international will hit the ground 20 times.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/e9e8963f-9e07-44a0-be27-86a5d91dc494/thumbnail/770x578/63159cb70e1fd6017bebdefbc5afa8d4/drop-machine-2.jpg
A package falls rapidly after the machine slammed it to the floor.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/6e562a19-07b8-4777-a61e-f97977c42b65/thumbnail/770x578/65155eee38dbb4b7dd268728659d634d/vibration-machine.jpg
This is the Package Lab's vibration machine. Packages are put on this machine and vibrated to mimic what they'll go through on a FedEx truck or airplane.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/b55e98a7-e70d-4bf1-af15-8e31c31d9aad/thumbnail/770x578/a1c2d4b972a9a2c1ed122ba065be6dd8/compression-machine.jpg
In order to test how strong a package is, the lab puts them into this compression machine, which applies significant pressure. If the box buckles before too much pressure is applied, it's clear that it will not withstand being stacked under many other boxes.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/52d19840-5d21-4287-9c21-ebde5ab93c0a/thumbnail/770x578/6163daf9875fe8533212f0ce7ce5ca78/freight-machine.jpg
Large freight packages are put on this sled and then slammed backward to mimic the beating they'll take either on a truck or plane, or when someone is carrying them around on a forklift.

This machine lets lab engineers test how a package or its contents will perform at high altitudes. The idea is to see if it can perform satisfactorily when being driven, say, over the Rocky Mountains.
 
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/181c13fd-da64-4003-99e0-962baabb5edb/thumbnail/770x578/1876d5cfdc338351714903a64632597a/temperature-machine.jpg
This machine can subject a package to hot or cold temperatures, in order to be sure it, or its contents, can survive those extremes.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/10/7c02d925-dda3-426a-8422-a97b15818878/thumbnail/770x578/2be666b94ca887006b303e79389f8ee1/cubesat-shot.jpg
FedEx has begun shipping CubeSats, or small satellites, and helped some of its clients by designing a custom package for the devices.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/9dbb6fa0-8f50-48bc-b7d7-48ab4d6a2c41/thumbnail/770x578/9b4c4353c2d4dd659a9b07fcf98d3e5f/guitars.jpg
Another service offered by the Package Lab is package design.
Customers who want to find a new way to box up various products can ask
the lab to help them customize a solution. An example is these three guitars, which are similar but subtly different. The manufacturer wanted to find a single package that could hold any one of them, rather than having to rely on a different type of box for each.&nbsp; The idea is to allow the company to save money by being able to buy boxes at scale. FedEx came up with a way to achieve the goal.

At FedEx's Memphis hub, sorting 1.5 million packages
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/b3bd2014-9d1d-44c0-bf5b-3b37b2162746/thumbnail/770x578/dacd672e1f6acaa62f5274348fef471a/md-11.jpg
Every night, FedEx sends 140 planes to Memphis, and then sends 140 planes back out. Every one of the 1.5 million packages that comes through the World Hub will be sent back out toward its final destination.FedEx operates numerous types of planes, including this McDonnell Douglas MD-11. It also flies Boeing 777s, 767s, and 757s; Airbus 300s and 310s; and McDonnell Douglas MD-10s.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/53f55855-1ad8-442d-9bfa-1649281bd68e/thumbnail/770x578/af4b5e930cf0c165d64d557f60c13bb5/unloading-md-11.jpg
A FedEx crew works feverishly in the rain to unload thousands of packages from an MD-11.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/57bad6f1-d963-4371-b597-2d1cd9498845/thumbnail/770x578/22ebc27d95d8ad18fc5c53047ecdbfc5/containers-outside-plane.jpg
Workers check out containers full of thousands of packages that have just been unloaded from a FedEx MD-11 at its Memphis World Hub.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/06bf012a-c190-4c13-a3f4-c1cd56334765/thumbnail/770x578/d200955d8389b8972d414eb04cf2ed8b/hubinput.jpg
After packages are unloaded from planes at FedEx's Memphis World Hub, they're brought to one of nine Input areas: five for domestic packages and four that handle international, heavyweight, and dangerous-goods packages.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/0745a86f-b209-482c-b561-8472d0e4da1c/thumbnail/770x578/8a4e60469e95b7d5fcb61faf300eaa74/flooding-the-matrix.jpg
One container's worth of packages -- about 235 -- floods into the Matrix. From there, FedEx workers take them and send them out on conveyors, where they're scanned and sorted for placement on planes that will take them to their final destination.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/11/49bef5e3-6466-49f7-8923-ecc253cc9af8/thumbnail/770x578/a65a6fbb53610de6b19b035be84ea952/matrix.jpg
Workers at the Matrix process thousands of packages an hour.

At FedEx's Ground Hub in Olive Branch, a six-sided scanner makes it possible for the company to send packages down a conveyor regardless of which side the label with the bar code is on. At its World Hub, workers have to ensure that the label is not facing down, because scanners can only see five sides of a package.

A look out the rear of the chapel shows how Fay Jones made even the angles of the back of the chairs blend into the space.

At first the schoolteacher who conceived the idea of building a glass chapel in the Ozark woods didn't understand Jones' design.

Just across the parking lot from Thorncrown Chapel is the related, also Fay Jones-designed, Worship Center.

Inside Frank Lloyd Wright's only skyscraper
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/289bf498-643e-48e2-bc58-3949e868b5a8/thumbnail/770x578/1c8a5cbb184532731a8e7f5aade1f73f/pt-from-the-west-aerial.jpg
A look at Price Tower from the west, as photographed by a DJI Phantom 2 Vision + quadcopter. The 19-story building is visible from nearly everywhere in Bartlesville.Today, the building is managed by the Price Tower Arts Center, a nonprofit. However, there are also a hotel, a bar, and some private offices still in use in the building.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/754606a5-d9c4-43f0-9017-5d30c9cf9a3e/thumbnail/770x578/550e3c69f3a912bc6277e4b3516b949b/louvers-with-owl.jpg
Though the Price Tower has louvers on all sides, these are the only ones that are meant to be moved intentionally. Found on the veranda outside what was originally the Price Company's corporate apartment, they are topped with a fake owl that scares off birds.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/5caed431-7862-4fef-a1ca-57409c8d6635/thumbnail/770x578/ca57a261beedb7837f5f2d9d2ed70ac0/corporate-apartment-1.jpg
For Wright, a skyscraper meant a building that was used in many different ways. So the Price Tower contained apartments, offices, and retail space. This is the Price Company's corporate apartment, which was used by the company's VIP guests, or its employees when they were in Bartlesville. It has been maintained to look much like it did when the Price Company was still using the building.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/50046355-b783-4a21-bca0-93c1c4b74968/thumbnail/770x578/2ca50d92261d0be0cddfb04f46f4423f/corporate-apartment-flw-mural.jpg
Another look at the corporate apartment, including an abstract mural Wright had painted on the wall of the apartment.

In the bottom right corner of the mural in the corporate apartment, Wright left this inscription to Hal Price: "The Blue Moon - To Hal. Frank Lloyd Wright." This was a reference to Wright's feeling that his collaboration with Price was so good as to be as rare as a blue moon.

Wright enjoyed putting built-in furniture in his buildings because it gave him more control over how people would use them. An example is this built-in table in the Price Tower corporate apartment.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/a6dbff97-478a-4226-9c19-883d8796f6ee/thumbnail/770x578/e644d075e199d8fe9a88a7a0998220ea/photo-14.jpg

The kitchen in the corporate apartment was suitably small, but it did the job, and included all the important appliances. Underneath the stove are both the oven and the refrigerator.

This aerial view of Price Tower, also shot with a DJI Phantom 2 Vision +, shows the building from the west, and makes it easy to see the huge veranda outside what was Hal Price's private office.

A final look at the corporate apartment, showing the drapes, and several chairs Wright designed.

Wright's buildings are famous for having leaks, and Price Tower is no exception. This built-in shelf in the corporate apartment was damaged by leaked water.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/834a5341-751a-4622-8851-ab934bdd29aa/thumbnail/770x578/11c5d7e4b410b93f956eea38a643dfa8/pt-from-the-north-aerial.jpg

When the Price Company was still using the Price Tower, its board consisted of only four members, so its boardroom was this foyer space just outside the elevators on the 18th floor.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/092aaaea-cd3b-4be2-8504-845266b27d4a/thumbnail/770x578/409749f792f491545d0732230f823359/globe.jpg
Almost everywhere you look in and around Price Tower are sharp angles, especially triangles. There are few, if any, circles.When Price and Wright were still in the design stage, Price insisted on a large map of the world for his wall, but Wright hated the idea. Still, as the owner of a global pipeline company, Price needed to have a map of the world in his office so he could consult with clients about the location of their projects. The compromise was this globe. Wright had it placed behind the door.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/2783ec39-0d55-45c1-970a-abf17c4b9057/thumbnail/770x578/b0da3e5d2f4dbc7de78d1d34f6b5a765/hcp-desk-1.jpg
In Price's office, Wright designed a built-in desk that could be used from either side. It has drawers on both sides, a chair on one side, and this bench on the other.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/a51f47a4-ebfc-407a-a055-efe51e5bc93d/thumbnail/770x578/4673c6f82ab4dc6092d6039d199c428d/hcp-desk-with-abstract-mural.jpg

A signature of Wright's buildings, even his skyscraper, is the fireplace. This one is located in Price's private office.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/d498103d-352e-4796-898f-30053d5ef088/thumbnail/770x578/317339f788bf01ca8103282e625c7df7/flw-chairs.jpg
Wright designed these chairs, which were used throughout the Price Company. They were said to be very uncomfortable.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/b32c6ffe-7934-46d6-82e7-00ff2b2390d7/thumbnail/770x578/e770230276cb3ee04309b9a13666166e/flw-desk-chair-hcp-office.jpg
This is the desk chair used by Hal Price in his private office. Wright also designed this chair.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/650098a6-814a-4b18-8b01-74335c878a18/thumbnail/770x578/269fb74ef3d9c1823b5e3d0f6fb3d11f/hanging-desk-lamp.jpg
Wright designed this hanging desk lamp, which utilizes the triangle shape, because he hated the idea of a lamp being placed on the desk.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/d8caa694-acde-4b3e-9950-221d77c2b51b/thumbnail/770x578/26dd93e682de180fa6e98a8d5a6f2ca7/triangles-in-ceiling.jpg
Look at just about any ceiling in Price Tower and you'll find more triangles.

This is Hal Price's secretary's desk, which is located just outside Price's private office on the 19th floor.

Wright designed this large carpet, which was originally installed in a separate house Wright designed for the Price family.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/8f795edf-496e-4755-b39e-16c5cf243435/thumbnail/770x578/2c0505b5d01e88065ab65b19134dac30/hcp-logo.jpg
Wright designed a corporate logo for the Price Company, and every floor of the building has one embedded there. The building is oriented in the same direction as the logo.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/852b2f0b-38d2-454b-81e3-6ecc153608f1/thumbnail/770x578/26f9836b19ed1356fc4c27dbb7a91e08/copper-bar-1.jpg
Though the Copper Bar, located inside the Price Tower, was not designed by Wright, the space was set up by someone trying hard to be faithful to his aesthetic.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/3ab1bc98-c6de-418c-8765-ba6f42b22ef0/thumbnail/770x578/5ff608e191cddcc18ba28a25dbca0b61/copper-bar-3.jpg

Today, this is the building's main foyer, but when Price Tower opened, this ground-floor space was a dress shop, helping to meet Wright's requirement that the building be mixed-use.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/18/404140ab-67c3-4bd5-bb40-72f238dc62eb/thumbnail/770x578/62f82bf4f0efb72317bedd07ecbfc27e/pt-phillips-66.jpg
A view of the Price Tower from several blocks away in Bartlesville. In the foreground is a Phillips 66 gas station. Bartlesville is best known as the corporate headquarters of Phillips Petroleum, later Conoco Phillips. And the Phillips company purchased the Price Tower when Price himself decided he didn't need it any more.

Here you can see what is known as a "barrel," the very beginning of a front section. The barrel is comprised of several smaller sections known as mandrels. Once the mandrels assembled, a giant machine methodically winds thousands of pounds of composite "slit tape" around the barrel, gradually forming the shape of the forward section.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/2d65b037-d3e0-4e7a-85d4-751305ee9421/thumbnail/770x578/b56eeba3289b4995245191591c8e43ce/barrell-begun-winding-different-angle.jpg
Still being wrapped in composite material, the barrel is suspended between two sides of this giant blue tool. Once the wrapping is complete, the barrel will be placed in one of the world's largest autoclaves.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/66c7904a-9f1a-4f84-87a5-c912f3bc4b90/thumbnail/770x578/f9ed849425da74dabe76d76506de9c08/bag-over-barrell.jpg
Before all the different mandrels are put in place, the incomplete barrel is wrapped in this "bag." Once the final mandrel is added, the bag will be removed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/c1a826a3-094b-4551-a8bc-104c277465e5/thumbnail/770x578/30d228280e9003868299450ff2e1f09d/mandrel-with-window-impressions.jpg
A mandrel section already shows where the Dreamliner's windows will be cut out.

Most of Boeing's airplanes have traditionally been made with aluminum. But with the 787 Dreamliner, it began using composite materials. These are rolls of the composite tape that will be wrapped around a barrel.

A giant tool automatically applies the composite tape to the barrel.

When it was built in the mid-2000s, this was the world's largest autoclave. Now, it's just inches shorter than the world's biggest.When the Dreamliner barrels are ready, they are placed in here and "cooked" for about 10 hours. Spirit Aerosystems doesn't reveal the temperature or pressure that the barrels undergo.Just to the left of the autoclave is the door, which is rolled into placed and locked prior to "cooking."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/7d98bb4c-7cc6-48de-a7cb-2f07c66a876f/thumbnail/770x578/529ab7264b8260144860c9b88a89294f/1204847-004.jpg
In this photo, we see a Dreamliner barrel inside the autoclave -- though the cooking only happens when the door is locked in place.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/5fff93b0-1c70-4ce5-9cb1-68d2a7f1e21c/thumbnail/770x578/2b6d14c3af4b43a068360b3476951365/out-of-autoclave-no-markings.jpg
When a barrel goes into the autoclave, it is black. When it comes out, it is this silver color. That makes it easy to tell if a Dreamliner barrel has been in the autoclave or not. When the barrel comes out, it's also entirely smooth, with nothing cut out.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/85260529-b231-489f-a85d-a8eb2d4ea86c/thumbnail/770x578/b44cdcc79086d474010bc24e35fdcfa0/out-of-autoclave-window-markings.jpg
The next step is to mark the various areas that must be cut out of the barrel, such as the windows and exit doors.

Next, workers cut out the various windows, doors, and landing gear sections.

Here, we see a Dreamliner front section canted to one side as it sits in the trim and drill position. The front section can be rotated on its central axis any way that's necessary to allow workers the easiest access.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/19/dd40ce6d-ee2e-4137-82bd-cbeb1e0fa9cd/thumbnail/770x578/65357f05cb10f831687e57c38081797f/fastening-pieces-to-structure.jpg
A front section is suspended upside down as workers fasten various components to its structure to increase its strength. These components are generally aluminum or titanium and are only installed on the interior of the structure.

In the final assembly area, Spirit works on installing systems in as many as eight Dreamliner front sections at a time, while also having two stations where the Dreamliners are powered-up for the first time.

Until reaching final assembly, the Dreamliner front section is largely an empty cylinder.

Even though this Dreamliner is still just a front section, it is powered up prior to shipping to Boeing. Many of the cockpit systems are tested as if the plane was complete. The aircraft doesn't know that it doesn't have wings or the rest of its body.

Here, we see a Spirit technician working inside the all-aluminum front of a 737 cockpit, seen inside Spirit's massive facility here.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/24/8f1eb829-b406-48b6-9ec4-a66283a70155/thumbnail/770x578/2831ba186e8257e64ee6a30a341a560a/0601238-001.jpg
This is "Integration," where all six major sections of a 737 are fused together into a full fuselage. At Spirit Aerosystems, the spot from which this photo was taken is known as the "scenic overlook."
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/07/24/dd3f358a-a44b-49a5-9bee-41f18211f4fc/thumbnail/770x578/4d192389e1c4a9f932ad8eb8cbec013b/0602281-004.jpg
Last month, a train carrying 737 fuselages to Boeing in the Seattle area derailed in Montana, causing three of the fuselages to end up in a river. But normally, the trains make it to Washington safely, looking just like this.

In the Gulf of Mexico, from oil rigs to fish havens

Most of the decommissioned rigs have their platforms severed, and only begin at 85 feet below the surface. This rig, technically known as a production platform, is the High Island 389. Owned by W&amp;T Offshote, it's under consideration for donation to the Texas Rigs to Reefs program. As of today, it has not had its platform severed but it is considered officially idle.

It's estimated that each of the artificial reefs in the program can be home to between 12,000 and 14,000 fish. The High Island 389, while not yet part of the program, is already home to teeming marine life.

Many species of fish call High Island 389 their home. It's not yet clear what will happen to the oil rig, which is currently "idle," according to W&amp;T Offshore, the company that owns it.

The average decommissioned oil rig has piles -- legs -- that go down 200 feet or more below the surface. The High Island 389, which is not yet part of the Rigs to Reefs program, goes down 300 feet, and fish can be found all the way down -- though most of those depths are below the range of recreational scuba divers.

$320 Million Bills
It's hard to know how you're going to feel starting at $320 million in cash.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/648f4a62-c15e-4b86-9e02-0df8e9cca037/thumbnail/770x578/87a0d219ae695464e37691b5f479dcd8/electroplating-quick-wash-with-silver-nitrate.jpg
One of the earliest stages of the production process is known as electroplating.In this part of the process, technicians take a plastic master sheet, known as a "basso," and, as seen here, spray it with silver nitrate, which serves as an electrical conductor, according to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.The plate is submerged in a tank of nickel salt solution, and electrical current is added. At that point, nickel ions transfer from the solution to the surface of the master, which is electrically charged.The plate is left in the tank for 22 hours, after which a nickel plate, known as an "alto," has literally grown.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/164864da-9c0c-44ef-b9a7-17e947f654c1/thumbnail/770x578/4fbc538ca6de4103d38072060c0ea90b/electroplating-dropping-in-solution.jpg
Here, we see a Bureau of Engraving and Printing technician dropping the plastic master plate into the nickel salt solution.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/9adbcf97-883a-48f9-b6b0-f2da7c4c1242/thumbnail/770x578/4cee3fc9997495239683513e91ebc8b4/electroplating-grown-alto-plate.jpg
This is an "alto," a nickel plate that has literally grown onto the surface of the plastic master after 22 hours in the nickel salt solution.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/4d19fde1-4537-4cee-9b82-efa36349ef80/thumbnail/770x578/07e5fc605f6d13ba407148e40bc72f51/electroplating-alto-separated-from-master.jpg
After technicians pull the plate out of the solution, they physically separate the alto from the plastic master. The alto is a perfect negative image of the original plastic master plate.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/4100907e-61ed-4a22-8299-dbfc4772989c/thumbnail/770x578/142ac1043d38a97ffbde1cf4c74f2a73/tracing-numbers.jpg
In the facility's engraving department, a team of engravers etch many of the features of the $100 bill into steel dies, making what were originally designers' models into 3D engravings. To do so, they employ tools known as gravers, as well as acids.Complicating matters, the engravers must etch all the features in reverse, since the dies will be pressed onto a plate.Each engraver works on different elements of the notes. Seen here, an engraver is etching numbers, which are then automatically transferred by a pantograph onto a plate that will be used in the printing process.
 
http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/a657b1fb-0428-46b5-a875-9046f57eeb14/thumbnail/770x578/fcdf4a8df2bf14fbf8c64916471a3ead/pantographing-numbers.jpg
A pantograph transfers the engraver's etchings onto each note on a plate.
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/5780b38a-8ff6-48c7-8f32-37ee4b5d1b23/thumbnail/770x578/7f44e6a169f9936129e7fd096e39b649/inspecting-at-engraving.jpg
Using a magnifying glass, an engraver inspects a plate for any kind of defect.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/d2d1d582-058e-4b84-81c4-a1e69d994ced/thumbnail/770x578/464902174df339d334a946febd927a44/numbers-engraved-on-plate.jpg
In the lower left hand corner of the right-hand note on this plate, you can see the reverse image of the number 346, which has just been added by a pantograph after an engraver etched it.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/0aa81064-3494-4f23-b902-5c461ce2cc8a/thumbnail/770x578/64c940a4d0721ab2a269a38af8d811a2/tools-of-the-trade.jpg
These are an engraver's 'tools of the trade,' many of which are hand-made by the engraver, or passed down from generation to generation. The tools can sometimes be 100 years old.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/8b7c5d27-5113-4646-b430-21c9d9bc58d2/thumbnail/770x578/a4028d08b93bfa4a796ab4eba25b9b13/chromed.jpg
After being pantographed, plates have chrome added in order to increase their longevity, meaning they can be used again and again in the printing process.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/085d6d1d-dac4-43f6-9661-9ccd321f379a/thumbnail/770x578/9de14ada9a1e58a7b69389f1e970f263/chromed-plate-at-inspection.jpg
After having the yellow solution washed off, a chrome plate is held up for inspection.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/6580b814-3417-4c06-8cad-049725852562/thumbnail/770x578/3bbdd6ac490f0675f86b30eee0651307/single-subject-at-photo-engraving.jpg
In the Western Currency Facility's photo-engraving department, technicians use computers to design specific elements of the notes, such as a feather and inkwell from the back side of the $100 bill, which are then printed onto film.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/a61d0685-9d3c-46a2-82bd-d8d55ea1e548/thumbnail/770x578/8f12d547107d5dc63c850d8e94f7f80f/photographing-film-one-color-at-a-time.jpg
The film is then exposed, one color at a time -- blue, copper, tan, and yellow -- to an image setting machine. Each film is one color.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/ff90c3af-1b7c-4b64-aad1-bbb596a97822/thumbnail/770x578/072a016e57bb2cfaeb5a770bc488a12b/plate-after-filming.jpg
A plate, like the one seen here, is generated based on the photographs taken by the image setter. That plate is then put into a printing press.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/a314301a-542b-47fb-8125-4e48e0862928/thumbnail/770x578/32d6d2822beb90bb29eb28a5e081bdb0/plates-on-printing-press.jpg

A sheet with several elements already printed is examined on a light table to make sure the notes' watermarks are in the right place.
 
http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/5e11cccd-4b40-4245-a873-983a854ec637/thumbnail/770x578/441e2afaac0e6f738a2500001c9cf5ee/printing-sheets-1.jpg
The front sides of 32-note sheets are printed as they make their way through this printing press. First one side, then the other is printed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/dfd542de-52d4-4d40-b25c-c2feb665f038/thumbnail/770x578/b22971568e3cd42080a589ed5cc0eecc/many-stacks-of-currency-drying.jpg
Countless stacks of currency sit and dry for 72 hours, before they are brought back to the printing process in order to have their back sides printed.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/b4f325d5-4629-4df4-b14a-a5aa4fd1cd30/thumbnail/770x578/d9871e01415e369b202cf5f3b6d4b56d/printed-backs-in-the-printer.jpg
The back sides of the sheets have now been printed.

A technician uses the "jogger," a machine that blows air into the stacks of bills after they've dried for 72 hours. He also uses his hands to separate them.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/9e29e02e-22a5-4849-80dd-7466df1e81b9/thumbnail/770x578/5b2720ddb82a4af32cbe7594daa48f16/holding-full-and-half-sheet.jpg
Two Western Currency Facility technicians hold up sheets of $100 bills. On the left side, we see a sheet that has been cut into two halves, while a full 32-note sheet is seen on the right.
 
http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/f919cbb3-235d-4272-baf3-cf99ca6121dd/thumbnail/770x578/174ffd0f69c741539d32308bc06eaf4c/camera-inspecting-for-defects.jpg
As 32-note sheets come off the press, a camera inspects them, looking for any defects. If they're detected, the sheets are automatically removed.
 
http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/12/eb91ff8d-5ee6-4f36-a40b-a0670bce0514/thumbnail/770x578/50a847f5e57a3e046eb1b63d3407bfc4/cutting-32-to-16.jpg

Stacks of packaged $100 bills are seen at the Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas. These bills are destined for the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco.

Western Currency Facility plant manager Charlene Williams (left) and a fellow Bureau of Engraving and Printing employee show off a 50-subject sheet of $1 bills -- which the facility now prints -- and an old 32-note sheet. The facility is currently only printing 50-subject $1 bills, but plans to expand to other denominations soon.

The $100 bill features many anti-counterfeiting measures, including tiny print that is invisible to the naked eye, and which is extremely difficult to reproduce. In this image, the letters "USA" are repeated again and again on the lower edge of the note, and the words "United States of America" are repeated on Benjamin Franklin's collar.
